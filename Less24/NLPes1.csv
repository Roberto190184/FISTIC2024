"b'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\' indians that doesn\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- "" south park "" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute\' indian tribe that packer\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\' or revealing what\'s underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker\'s songs are very catchy . \nyou\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\'s a shpadoinkle day\' out of your head once you\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every "" south park "" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\'s song\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\'s songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that\'s a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\'ve ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n'",1

"" \n- ernie hudson , as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death . \ncomic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception . \ndespite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee\'s final film doesn\'t fly very high . \nthe story opens on halloween eve , better known as devil\'s night . \nwilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from . \nthe cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order . \nshe dies , the perps . \nescape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge . \nsound familiar ? \nunlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee\'s character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 . by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration . \nwearing what appears to be alice cooper\'s leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner . \nbut no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman . \n ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though . \n : ) \na nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can\'t film a decent action scene to save his life . \nhis two "" best "" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith . \nblame said editors for the film\'s frightful flashbacks , as well . \nbut the pace is quick , thank god , and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins . \nthe cast is better than it should be . \nernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film\'s funnier lines . \nnewcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and draven\'s scrappy ward . \njon polito has a small , succulent role as pungent pawnbroker . \nand michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr . big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii . \nthere can be only one . \nfinally , there\'s brandon lee , son of bruce lee , and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting . \nlee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie , laser mission , showdown in little toyko , and rapid fire-- and the crow would\'ve been a nice feather in his belt and that\'s about it . \nthere\'s nothing great from him here-- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability . \nwhen the echo of that gunshot finally fades , watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience . \ndespite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity , the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren . \nfor now , maybe it\'s an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better . \n'",0
"b'miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . \nthey ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film\'s february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . \nyou see , \'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain\'t it cool news . \nno , the ? mini major\' was afraid we\'d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . \nsomething smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney\'s mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . \n ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) \nof course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream\'s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? \nthe backseat ? \nthe next car ? \nthrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton\'s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . \nwhat\'s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3\'s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . \nour other surviving regulars have become estranged . \nsidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2\'s movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . \nmurder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney\'s death . \nthe appeal of ghostface\'s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . \nscream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . \nironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there\'s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . \nwith scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface\'s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . \nconceptually . the execution of ghostface\'s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we\'d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" \nin reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy\'s third act , but there\'s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . \nwith the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of "" stab 3 "" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . \ncraven\'s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . \nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . \nit pains me to write this , but scream 3\'s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven\'s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . \nthe visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming\'s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . \n ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) \nfinally , marco beltrami\'s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it\'s mostly silent . \nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . \ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . \nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint\' . \n'",0

"b"" ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . \nelijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . \ntea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . \nalso featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . \nwhile many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . \nthe main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . \nonly the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . \nand because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . \nthe script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . \nmimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . \nthe cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . \nshe seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . \nrobert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . \nelijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e . \nflipper , 1996 ) . \nhis role is also vastly underwritten . \nmorgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . \nlike duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . \nthe supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . \nok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? \nwell , yes and no . \nalthough the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . \nsadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all . \nsurprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . \nin the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . \nwhat could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . \nthe 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . \nonce again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . \nlet's hope armageddon is a bit better . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n""",0
"b'it\'s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . \nthe movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . \nosmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there\'s something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . \nnot that there\'s anything wrong with scatology . \ni bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . \nit\'s merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . \nyou can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . \nosmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . \nthe trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . \nadults ? well , let\'s just say most will find it unappetizing . \nosmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . \nthe live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . \nhe continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . \nfrank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . \nhe works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . \nfrank\'s body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . \nit\'s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . \nnope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate\'s mouth . \nlike i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . \nafter ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . \nhere , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier\'s david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . \nbasically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . \nand this is why osmosis jones doesn\'t click . \nit merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . \nthe jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . \nafter pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn\'t look fluish . "" \nand the jokes don\'t rise above that level . \nthe live action scenes are no better . \nfrank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . \nhe\'s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . \nosmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . \nthe animation is rather two-dimensional and flat . \nit lacks scope and depth . \nit is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater . \n'",0

"b""in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n""",1

"b'mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin\' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . \' \naustin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery . \nmany are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film . \naustin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles . \nhe reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth . \ntswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil\'s ? frisch\'s big boy\' space capsule floating through space . \ndr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers\' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents . \nupon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me . \nthe evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil\'s son in the madman\'s mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil . "" \ndr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one . \ndr . evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner . \ndr . evil loving ? \nwow ! \nmike myers\' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil\'s , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers\' frozen body . \naustin powers learns of dr . evil\'s trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . \nonce arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . \nas the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , "" don\'t go there , girlfriend ! "" \nto the president of the united states . \nmany witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they\'re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . \ntake for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . \nthe way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . \nthere was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn\'t laughing . \nthe last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! \nit is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . \nthe film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it\'s funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . "" \ntswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . \ni can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . \ni believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . \ndr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . \ni felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . \nalso making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . \neven though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil\'s side constantly . \nthe first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . \nmike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . \n ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . \nheather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . \nspeaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . \nhopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . \nthe bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . \n'",1
"b'dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london . \nto boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story . \nmovies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it . \nalex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly . \nat times it moves beyond film into artwork . \nit is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? . \nthese aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning . \nthey are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight . \nduring this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) . \nwithout a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him . \ni don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him . \nit ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography . \nmurdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight . \nshadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine . \nwe see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song . \na great entrance . \nhowever , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied . \nthe city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching . \nblade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience . \nit is discussed it and argued , therefore a success . \nother science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy . \nwe ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element . \ndark city is not so easily explained away . \nas the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task . \nwhere is reality ? \ndark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films . \nperhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger . \nanyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it . \n'",1
"b'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \nit\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his "" attorney "" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \nit doesn\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\'re laughing , we\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important . \nnow it\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\'t seem to approve , doesn\'t do anything to stop it either . \nby the time this scene takes place , they don\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \nduke seems to realize at some level that he\'s become something he doesn\'t like , but he\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \nthere\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\'t usually very pleasant . \nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \ni\'m not sure if he\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \n'",1
"b'men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way . \nalthough another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn\'t , and towers above many other movies of its type . \nthe brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets . \ndirector barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece . \nthe story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be . \nthe men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist . \nthe mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe "" . \na though job , indeed . \nthe film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states . \npresumably , these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers . \nthat is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them . \nagent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien . \nwhen the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib\'s very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them . \nthe device , described as "" out of state "" , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on . \n>from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith . \nedwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal . \nthe criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground . \nedwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him . \nedwards doesn\'t take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder . \nback at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions . \nhe informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made . \nhe has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day . \nedwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he . \nafter goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do . \nin the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter . \nedgar ( vincent d\'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport . \nthe "" bug "" , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors . \nand it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war . \nmen in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film . \nthe special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer . \nscreenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros . \nand the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story . \nall ages will enjoy men in black . \nit is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again . \nalthough it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . \nthe ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done . \na sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to ! \n'",1

"b'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . \nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . \nthe result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn\'t build on to show them as the poets they were . \non paper , this shouldn\'t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . \nbut the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . \ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . \nhe , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . \nbut when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . \nleonardo\'s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud\'s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . \nthe film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . \nhe accepts verlaine\'s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . \nonce there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine\'s busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family\'s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . \nwhen verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they\'re bad poets . "" \nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . \nverlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . \nwhen mathilde\'s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . \nit\'s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . \nin brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . \nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . \nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . \nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . \nthe film ends on a whimper . . . with \nverlaine talking with rimbaud\'s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . \nthis film was especially annoying because rimbaud\'s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . \ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn\'t work . \nit certainly didn\'t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . \n'",0
"b'if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer\'s biggest pleasures . \nif only . \nin fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one . \ntake the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff . \nafter being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead . \nbut suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he\'s only injured . \na similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it . \ndid the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ? \napparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone . \ndo i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ? \nhaving said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits . \nthe basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr . evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power\'s "" mojo "" ( don\'t you just love that word ? ) \nwhilst he is cryogenically frozen . \nwhen austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley\'s vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham . \nthis sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me . \nthen there\'s mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a . . . \npetite clone of myer\'s dr . evil , exactly 1/8 in size . \ntroyer\'s persona alone gains the film an extra half-star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini-mr . \nbigglesworth . \njust try to ignore the fact that , at 2\'8\'\' , he would make dr . evil\'s height rise to just over 21 feet . \nno matter . \nhowever , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that just isn\'t enough to warrant even a minor recommendation . \nif there is in fact an "" austin powers 3 "" , they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr . evil and mini-me . \nunconventional , yes , but there\'s no denying that it\'d make for a better movie . \n'",0

"b""along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view . \nfor all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart . \nthe australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . \naccepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood . \nit was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face . \nbraveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film . \nfor three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest . \nthe william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries . \nseeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland . \nas the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up . \nhis courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son . \nhowever , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought . \nbraveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays . \nmel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast . \npatrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank . \nthe scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good . \nsophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart . \ni also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace . \nhowever , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor . \nthe excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is . \nwhen we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film . \nbraveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 ! \ni've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean . \nfor now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia . \nit won't be easy ! \nit's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson . \n""",1

"b'what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60\'s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn\'t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don\'t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn\'t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! "" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n'",0
"b""in our time . \nin our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . \nand yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic . \nin warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away . \nthough the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry . \nthe film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese . \nthe youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered . \nthe afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . \nit is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . \nescaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate . \nbut before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty . \nthe only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . . \nthere's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production . \nand there are more problems besides its title . \nof course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece . \nwe call it 'modernization' . \nit seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights . \nthis lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing . \nkenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . \nand as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare . \ni must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing . \ni can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing . \nhe manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision . \nunfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments . \nhis latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow . \nthe love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . \njet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . \ntheir achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act . \nthey are nothing more than two celebrities put together . \nthe other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances . \ndelroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality . \nbut there's more than acting to worry about . \neven with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing . \nto make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film . \nit is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . \nand in the end it's nothing . \nthere are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises . \nso again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . \nthis film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences . \nthe music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre . \nit is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it . \nbut when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' . \nas in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects . \nit is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any . \nfor someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film . \nfor those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells . \n""",0

"b'tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . \nall those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . \nif you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . \nit\'s hilarious . \nhow does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? \neasy . \nwrite an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . \nwill and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . \nat night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . \nthe only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . \nthe script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . \ntheir flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . \ngrieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . \nwhat follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . \nthe music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez\'s born to be alive . \nthe choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin\' alive . \nit is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . \none of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will \nand chris don\'t have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . \nan art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . \nit\'s a scene that\'s an approximate parody of the vinegar\'s own rolf luedeke\'s editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . \nted "" unabomber "" \nkaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . \nof course , the script wouldn\'t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . \nnevertheless , will\'s father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . \nduring the wedding ceremony , will\'s heart isn\'t exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . \ndefinitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . \ni found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi\'s head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . \nthe scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . \nmore art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . \nthe idiots\' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks \ndon\'t play well anymore ( she\'s a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . \ni recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in \nneed of a lot of laughs . \ngo with a date . \nbrandi laughed non-stop , as i \ndid , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes . \n'",1
"b'renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star\'s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \nwriter steven e . desouza\'s fairly straightforward plotline isn\'t as outre as _double_team_\'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \nit\'s all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \nwhile all of van damme\'s films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme\'s embarrassing directorial effort , 1996\'s _the_quest_ ) . \na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! "" \nand "" entrepreneurship , babycakes !

"b""retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \na timeless epic it is not . \nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \nalmost too 90's , it seems . \nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \n""",0

"b'the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . \nwhen anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king\'s ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . \nmeanwhile , the king\'s prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . \nthe last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king\'s son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . \nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i\'s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . \ni will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . \nthe screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe . \nliterally . \nspeaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . \nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . \nthe sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . \nunlike disney animated features , the king and i\'s songs don\'t add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . \ntake the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i\'s music is at its worst . \nyou\'re being hunted by a dragon ! \nwhat do you do ! ? \nsing a happy song ! \nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don\'t make a positive ? \nbelieve it ! \nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc . , etc . , etc . , "" more and more as the film progresses . \nno personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . \nand where does this character\'s personality change ? \nhey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! \nisn\'t that the whole plot ? \nthe prime minister\'s hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! \nanother one of his teeth fell out ! \nhardy-har-har ! \nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . \nby the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . \nanimated films , such as 1994\'s the lion king and 1998\'s the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . \nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . \ni have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . \nif it wasn\'t for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade . "" \ninstead , the king and i will just go down as among the year\'s worst . \nthe bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs . \nnot even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it . \nnot the slightest bit . \n'",0
"b'there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . \nthe scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . \nto one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . \njakob , however , never stops moving . \nit\'s an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody\'s idea of a hero at the outset . \nhe is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . \nthe set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . \nafter a visit to a german commandant\'s office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . \nwhen he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . \nthe good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . \na private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . \nthis promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . \ni am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year . \ncompare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . \njakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he\'s struggling _not_ to craft them . \nwhen he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . \noh yes , and then there\'s that little girl . \nsome viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero\'s fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren\'t problematic because they\'re familiar . \nthey\'re problematic because they\'re jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn\'t have been about cutesy relationships . \njakob\'s character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . \nevery scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . \nit is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . \ndirector peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker\'s novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . \nthere are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it\'s the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams\' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . \njakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . \nand after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . \n'",0
"b""the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time . \nunfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact . \nfrom the surface `patch adams' looks very promising . \nit's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people . \nwhen the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . \nin a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people . \nso he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . \nright from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . \nhe continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . \nshortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . \nthey , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . \nonce the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school . \npatch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . \nit's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor . \ni have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . \nit seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie . \nconsidering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . \nnot to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . \nrobin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . \nbut those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average . \n""",0
"b""the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \nit's director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n""",0
"b'richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn\'t disappointed . \nit wasn\'t a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what\'s with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn\'t really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won\'t be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he\'ll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier\'s father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail\'s investigator ( unfortunately , i don\'t remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can\'t remember where i\'ve seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged "" butcher boy of st . mike\'s "" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n'",1

"b'around the end of 1998 , a japanese cartoon came to the usa television , and really wasn\'t that big . \nin fact not many people even knew what pokemon was , but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike , and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time . \nin fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was , wasn\'t all that bad . \nit grossed $31 million in its opening weekend , and went on to make almost $90 million . \nfans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze , "" pokemon : the movie 2000 "" which is far inferior to the original animated movie . \nfirst up is the plot , which there really isn\'t much of , in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon , lugia , is about it , except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever . \nwell there you go , of course ash is followed by his friends misty , brock , gary and his pokemon friends , pikachu , squirtle , charizard , the usual . \neven though the first movie wasn\'t a great film , it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline . \nthis new movie however is nothing but garbage , there is nothing good to it storywise , and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors . \ncompared to the first film , this movie is awfully bland , from its opening titles , to the end titles it tries its best to work , but fails miserably at every corner . \nthe characters are 1-dimensional , the story thin as chicken broth , and the writing very lame . \neven the so called action scenes are extremely lame , and falls before it even gets a chance to go . \nthe voices even aren\'t that good and almost feels like the stars don\'t want to be there , like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie . \nwhich it certainly is . \nthe film has one thing going for it and that is the animation , although not up to disney standards , it is still very good with some interesting cgi\'s and very colorful animation , the colors jump out at you very fast , and seem very nicely put on film . \nwhy a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered , hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash . \nfor now watch the first one . \nits much much better . \n'",0

"b""if you've seen the trailers or commercials , it's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store . \nwell , it's hard to tell after watching the movie as well . \nbruce willis is a resident of the future , and it is a rather bleak future . \nthe world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200 , 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals . \nthe reason ? \nin 1995 , an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus , thus wiping out practically the world's population in a mere month . \nbruce willis' character is one of the surviving few , but is enslaved by scientists , as are most of last living humans . \nthey barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task : go into the past , find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys , and kill him . \nwell , this explanation didn't come easy . \nalthough the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people , our future and the evilo in the world , as a story it is very confusing . \nand dragging . \ni know a movie isn''t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it's only been an hour passed . \nterry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate , and i haven't watched his previous work brazil , but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out , you wish it were more complex , and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me . \n""",0
"b'the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could\'ve been effective . \nsuch is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . \nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . \nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . \nthe killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can\'t see the face . \ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . \nanyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . \nit\'s a very good setup that promises more chills to come . \nunfortunately , the film never takes off from there . \nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . \nlike most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . \ni\'ve always wondered why these killers don\'t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . \nafter the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . \nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . \ni guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . \nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . \nthe slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . \nfalse scares should always be used in moderation . \nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren\'t as scary as they used to be . \nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it\'s not frightening . \nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? \nthis movie still adheres to them . \ntons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . \nand i don\'t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . \nthat type of illogical can be fun . \nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . \nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you\'ll be laughing more than you\'ll be screaming . \nactually , you won\'t be screaming at all . \nat its best , the acting can barely be called "" adequate "" and the script could\'ve definitely used a rewrite or two . \nthe film still manages to have some strong points . \nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . \nthere are some intentionally funny moments . \n ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) \nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint . \nbesides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . \nif there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might\'ve been worth your money . \n'",0

"b""the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . \nit cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . \nhowever , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . \nunfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original . \nthe film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . \nelwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . \nas in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . \njohn belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . \nfirst , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . \ncabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . \nnext , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . \nfinally , there's buster ( j . \nevan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . \nthe plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it \nseems to be almost a clone of the original . \nelwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . \nthe first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . \nin fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . \nremember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? \nwell , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . \nthere's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . \nthere's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . \nthere are plenty of recurring characters too . \nin addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . \nfrank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . \nas the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy . \naykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . \njohn goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . \njoe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . \nand what's the deal with the orphan ? \nit plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film . \nat least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role . \nbut the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . \nand the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . \nalthough there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . \nto top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . \nb . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . \nunfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . \nif simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . \nit's a shame . \nbuy the soundtrack and avoid the film . \nbetter yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll \nhave a much better time . \n""",0

"b""_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it . \ni could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment . \nif there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day . \nthe story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? ) \nafter years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy . \nwho the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys . \nafter ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat . \nthere's a new wrinkle , though . \ntodd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place . \nafter losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet . \nif you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game . \nthe renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute . \nit's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples . \nunlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages . \nadd into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad . \nand the special effects ! \nremember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ? \ngary busey is in this movie . \n'nuff said . \n_soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults . \nthat this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all . \nnow if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future . \n""",0
"b""martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . \nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . \narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \nthe film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . \nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . \nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \n""",1

"b'clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another . \nmidnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn\'t even in , and it\'s damn good . \nadapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head . \nand that\'s just the mayor . \nas director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor . \nlike all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion . \nthe acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you\'d expect , but it\'s the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . \ncusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey\'s parties . \nlots of food , beverages and gunplay . \nyes , an employee of spacey\'s has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead . \nit seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there\'s much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in . \nthe weird circle of entertainment . \nthis is where the stable of supporting characters comes in . \nthere\'s the requisite sexy woman ( alison "" nepotist\'s daughter "" eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite . \nmiss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? \nchablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie\'s comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . \nthere are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . \ncertainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey\'s lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury\'s foreman . \nit\'s here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey\'s homosexuality . \nyes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course . \nmidnight in the garden of good and evil isn\'t a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there . \nlikewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great . \nin fact , i\'d almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category . \nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \n'",1

"b""the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . \nafter attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . \nafter a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . \nagain and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . \nthe characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . \nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . \nthat someone is death . \nyou see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . \nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . \nfor a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . \nalex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . \nin a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . \nafter a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . \nthe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . \nbut death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . \nthe grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . \nbefore i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . \nis that one helluva premise , or what ? \n`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . \non familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . \nunlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . \nyou just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . \nyoung viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . \nafter the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . \nlow and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . \nsome splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . \n`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . \nnot that the characters are that good . \nsawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . \nin addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . \naside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . \nthe personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! ' \ntoss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . . \n`spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments . \nnot so . \n`final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening . \nthe extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick . \nthe plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) . \nbut i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes . \ncreative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise . \nwhat will trigger the accident ? \nwill it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ? \n ( yeah , sick humor ) . \nwill it be the leaking toilet ? \nthe falling fishing reel in the corner ? \nthe murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward . \na sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach . \nit gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ? \nit's fun . \nin that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea . \nthis stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side . \nafter the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you . \nwhen will your ? design' expire ? \nis death waiting around the corner ? \nthe `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies . \n""",1

"b'in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . \nthe film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year\'s 100 million dollar grossing scream . \nwhen the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up . \ndid it live up to the first film ? \nthe answer is no . \njennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before . \nshe has been so upset since the incident . \nnightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on . \nshe know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle . \nkarla\'s boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food\'s mekhi phifer . \nfreddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie\'s boyfriend from a year ago . \none morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil . \nof course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas . \njulie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie . \nafter they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island . \nit starts off as the weekend of their dreams . \nsomething just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie\'s life though . \nben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn\'t letting anyone survive this time . \nwill ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? \njennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances . \nbrandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film . \nyou could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive . \nmatthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story . \nlet\'s start with settle . \nmatthew is completely fake in this film . \nyou could not believe a word coming out of his mouth . \nyou could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn\'t as good as the first one . \nhe does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn\'t clear up the scars he already left on the film . \nfreddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was . \nhe is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place . \nwe don\'t see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did . \nmekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place . \nthe plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . \ni like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better . \nthe cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful . \nthere are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel . \nthe sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film\'s . \njennifer love hewitt\'s song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds . \ni still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . \nthe first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes . \nthe last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film . \nbefore this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares . \nthat is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes . \ni think the reason this film wasn\'t as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident . \nhe made them suffer for what they did . \nin the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like . \nhe doesn\'t stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after . \nhe had to go after karla , will , and tyrell . \nif the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense . \nthe bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand . \n'",1

"b""`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . \nfor a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . \nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . \nbut , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . \nin these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . \n`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . \nin addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . \n`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . \ntykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . \nwith it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . \neven more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . \nas a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . \nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . \nmeanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . \nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty . \nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . \nthe other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . \nadditional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . \n`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . \nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . \nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . \nmost are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . \nbut , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . \na few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . \nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . \nperhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . \nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . \nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting . \n""",1
"b""disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . \nthere he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide . \nrichard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) . \nonce they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise . \nthis covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel . \nthe cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . \ni don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . \nbut that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . \nthough the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . \nthe plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . \nthis is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better . \nnow up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . \nthis is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . \nthere is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . \ni am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . \nthe character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . \nalthough there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . \nthe character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . \nthe next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . \nrichard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line . \nthis i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused . \nnow , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . \nthe cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . \nmind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . \nwhich begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? \n ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . \nbut i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . \nthe international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . \nnot to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . \nwhen all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . \ni would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . \nas it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . \nif you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings . \n""",0

"b""modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome . \nadapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen . \nliam neeson stars as jean valjean . \nas a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes . \nprison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . \nhowever , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man . \nhowever , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform . \ninspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider . \nhe has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions . \nhe once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice . \ntwo women also get caught up in the struggle . \nfantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society . \nher daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her . \ninstead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave . \ndirector bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book . \nhopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went . \nthe movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes . \nthe experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles . \nneeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past . \nthe supporting cast is also extraordinary . \nthe only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius . \nthe film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . \nthe novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length . \nwhile it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . \nit , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing . \n""",1
"b""summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \nthere's also problems with the plot . \njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \n""",0

"b'an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis\' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london . \nwhere the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms . \nwhere the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny . \nin short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) . \nthe film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping . \nsoon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all . \nshe jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) . \nserafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out . \nhowever , once he learns his would-be girlfriend\'s dark secret , he wishes he hadn\'t . \nshe\'s a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself . \nactress julie delpy is far too good for this movie . \nshe imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character\'s fate . \nthis isn\'t necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience . \ndelpy\'s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her . \ndelpy\'s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski\'s white and richard linklater\'s before sunrise . \nshe was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both . \ngiven the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives . \nit could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . \nand if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts . \nthe rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . \ntom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he\'s in a made-for-tv movie . \nit would be kind to call him bland . \nactors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy\'s friends , are no more impressive . \njulie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat . \nand respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal . \non the technical side , it\'s all bad news . \nthe computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal . \nthe creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . \nrepeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf\'s point-of-view approach that\'s interesting the first couple of times it\'s employed , then becomes tedious . \nand the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they\'re matched to . \ndirector anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel . \nas a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . \n ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that\'s rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a "" bad movie "" sort of way , but that\'s a dubious distinction . \nultimately , it\'s an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn\'t unbearable to sit through , it isn\'t a howl , either . \n'",0

"b""well i'll be damned . . . \nthe canadians can make a good movie . \nthe world is coming to an end . \nwe don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it . \nthe world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations . \nyet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on . \nthey aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets . \ninstead they are simply preparing themselves for the end . . . \nsome engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone . \nthese people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours . \nwriter-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film . \nall of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth . \ncraig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success . \neven minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . \nthings seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . \nsome moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . \nthe story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . \ni have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . \nbut i do wonder why the sun never sets . \ncome midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . \nmaybe the sun is crashing into the earth . . . \nwho knows . \nalso , it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that's not a shot at this film mind you . . . \ni know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) . \nlast night is available on dvd from universal home video . \nit contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer . \n[r] \n""",1
"b'any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . \nany meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it "" more accessible "" to the general public . \nor the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . \nhuman traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done . \nthe film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts . \nthe cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy . \nkoop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men . \nnina herself can\'t stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends . \nlulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip\'s best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends . \nand moff ( danny dyer ) can\'t seem to escape the black hole of his awful life . \nthe film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background . \nhuman traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan\'s subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action . \nthe use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters . \ndialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident . \nhowever , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed . \nhuman traffic does not try to explain the rave scene . \ninstead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace . \n'",1
"b'i\'ve always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs\' great performances . \nthe minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it . \nbesides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film . \ni got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there\'s this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . "" \n ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . ) \nthe film began . . . . \nthe film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett . \nhe loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon . \n ( i\'d put in his name , but my wife won\'t let me take notes during a movie and i\'ve forgotten it . ) \nthey continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him . \nbrackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her . \nthe wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual . \nkline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn\'t . \nthe whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference . \nhis closest friends don\'t help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party . \nthere are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity . \nkline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations . \nthe movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding . \nkline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . . \nif you want to be surprised , don\'t read , i am going to reveal the ending . \n . . . instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says "" i\'m gay .

"" \nit got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film . \nby the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon . \n ( much like this review you are saying ) \noverall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets . \nsee it in economy time . \n'",0

"b'for the first reel of girls town , you just can\'t get over lili taylor . \nis it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ? \nharder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ? \nwith the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster . \nit\'s a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you\'ve forgiven taylor her own maturity . \nfor all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood . \nthe movie\'s opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) . \nbut about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life . \nthe remaining girls manage to smug nikki\'s diary out of her grieving mother\'s home , and page through it at patti\'s place , investigating the root of nikki\'s despair . \nwhat they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen . \nshell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives . \nemma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player . \npatti\'s barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock\'s car . \nand anyway , patti\'s had her own share of guys who wouldn\'t take no for an answer . \npained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it . \n "" why do we put up with it ? "" \nemma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch . \n "" we try to talk about it , and look what happens . \nwe fight for 20 minutes . "" \nthere\'s the admirable crux of this picture . \ngirls town is a political film , in that it calls for action . \nbut it\'s incomplete-it\'s never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take . \nthe trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it\'s surely one of this year\'s most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock\'s car ( doing the right thing ? ) . \nthey hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall . \n "" subvert the patriarchy , "" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to . \nthe girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti\'s child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki\'s tormentor . \nstill , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying . \n ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . ) \nperhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( "" who you callin\' a bitch ? "" ) . \nthe points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary . \nlong on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste . \ndirector jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . \'s \nmichael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking . \nthe movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn\'t secure funding . \nthen again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film . \nthe movie\'s slapdash quality is key to its significance . \ntruth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that\'s ok -- there\'s a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination . \nfor all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place . \n'",1
"b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \ni\'m happy to say that there\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \nearl brown ) , who\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \nit seems warren\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\'t seen since that fateful day . \nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \nthere\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\' last two films ) they almost all work . \ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \none minute you\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\'s apartment . \none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \nted\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\'t always work out . \nit\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \nactually , i\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late \'92/early \'93 . \nlike "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\'s cancellation . \ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\'t change , and you know , it\'s really true . \nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \nmaybe they live in dick clark\'s pool house . \nanyway , here\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\'s heart . \nthe supporting performances are also good . \nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \nlin shae , who plays mary\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \nlee evans , as mary\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \nit\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there\'s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . \n'",1
"b' * * * warning - the following review contains spoilers * * * \ncast : gary sinise , don cheadle , connie nielsen , jerry o\'connell , kim delaney , tim robbins , elise neal , jill teed , jody thompson , bill timoney written by : jim thomas , john thomas and graham yost directed by : brian depalma running time : 115 minutes \nthe first big event movie of 2000 turns out to be anything but . \ngary sinise stars as an astronaut who is removed from a mars mission when his astronaut wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) , becomes ill and passes away . \ndon cheadle is then given the mission along with a russian couple and a young hotshot . \nwhen a strange whirlwind shot from the top of a mars mountain range attacks the crew of the mission , sinise and robbins convince their superior to let them , neilsen , and o\'connell perform a rescue mission for whatever crew might be remaining . \nwhat they discover on the surface of the planet will dramatically change their lives forever ( although no one watching the film will come away profoundly affected ) . \nbefore i ever saw the film , i was aware of the promotional campaign with dr . pepper . \nevery time i would see a bottle of the soft drink , the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it . \nlittle did i know that the plot would be taking a back seat to the product placement of the drink and several other products . \ndr . pepper saves the day at one point , and a dream sequence/flashback features jerry o\'connell shoving m&m\'s in our face . \nthese are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film . \nclich ? s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\'t like independence day ) . \nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\'t help but whisper "" u\'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \nennio morricone\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\'t reach its intended target . \nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be "" smarter "" than i am ) . \nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \na brief history lesson about "" where we came from "" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with "" the rest of our people "" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that "" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has "" ) . \n>from the press i\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \ni\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \nlet\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \ni\'d venture to say it won\'t be worse than this waste of time . \n[pg] \n'",0
"b'my friend here in film school just made a two minute-long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . \nas sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i\'ve ever witnessed . \nsure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? \nthen there\'s "" caligula . "" \nthis film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased-up fist forced up a man\'s rear , wine poured down a man who\'s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time . \nproduced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there\'s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . \nafter all , it\'s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . \nno film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it\'s about , it\'s about how it\'s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . \nthose who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that\'s that it\'s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \n "" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or \nso i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . \nthe film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . \nthe plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can\'t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o\' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . \nthen he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn\'t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . \nthe filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . \nbut instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione\'s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . \noh , isn\'t it great that they just loved having sex ? \nand that they killed people so disgustingly ? \nand wouldn\'t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it\'s so blatantly real bad porn that i\'ve completely convinced myself that it\'s not . \ni mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . \nand it\'s not just that it\'s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it\'s that in a film where the entire feel it\'s going for isn\'t felt , it\'s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . \nthe sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . \nbut that doesn\'t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . \nthe camera operation is also the worst i\'ve ever seen in my entire life . \nnot only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . \nthe editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . \nthere is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it\'s "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can\'t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . "" ) \nthe music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . \nthe orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" ) . \njohn gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i\'m going to kill my agent , i\'m going to kill my agent . . . "" \nand so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula "" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . \nguccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . \nthroughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with ! \nand if you don\'t like this , then you\'re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! "" \nuh huh . \nthere\'s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that\'s artistically good . \na film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . \nbut using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness\'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . \nthere\'s a film that came out in 1989 called "" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , "" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . \nthat film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . \nthere were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it\'s going to be offensive to many . \nthat film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . \nand it\'s everything "" caligula "" might have been but , alas , wasn\'t . \n'",0
"b' "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \nunfortunately , it\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven\'s gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad . \ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\'s "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\'s "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek ) . \nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \n "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\'s bare breasts . \n "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \ncomic books have better plots than this . \nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\'s comedy "" george of the jungle . "" \ndidn\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 ) . \nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \nof course , one can\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \nstrictly speaking , "" tarzan and the lost city "" isn\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \nthis movie proves what "" starship troopers "" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\'s like a charmless version of belloq from "" raiders of the lost ark . "" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \n "" tarzan and the lost city "" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \n'",0

"b""`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor . \ncertain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter . \ni chuckled incessantly , all the way home . \nlet me share . \nthe skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) . \nluke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report . \ndespite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization . \nsoon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account . \nyeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ? \nbut luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . \nthe premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense . \nunfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting . \nit's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . . \nbut not the script . \n`the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . \nfirst off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm . \nafterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar . \nwill they never take this watch off ? \nand what if they forget it by their bedside ? \nperhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed . \non top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . \ngee , why not member t-shirts ? \nbut my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions . \nthey are given official skull paddles . \nwhen flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . \nfacing the opposite way means a disagreement . \nwouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? \nhell no . \nthey have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong . \ni'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest . \nthe cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout . \nbut not entirely . \naccomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them . \nand then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor . \nmcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) . \ni pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors . \nthe young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better . \nlet's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character . \npaul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son . \nwalker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) . \nsome actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics . \nit really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one . \nor maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style . \nit makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . \naside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls' gets little accomplished . \nthe thrills and action are lazy and mechanical . \nthe story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick . \ninstead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage . \nwe've seen it all before , and better . \n`the skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded' seems just too generous . \n""",0

"b'this is the worst movie i\'ve seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way "" . \nit is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . \nit is crap through and through . \nnothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" ) . \nhere\'s a man who admits he\'s a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . \nbut truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . \nnot all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . \nthere is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . \nthey set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners . \nit turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . \nbut that\'s par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger\'s lines . \nas mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . \nthis is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass . \npersonally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn\'t retake scenes to make him understandable . \ncompare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin "" . \napparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . \numa thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . \nher poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . \nand her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she\'s reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment . \ngiven the "" script "" , it\'s a wonder it didn\'t happen more frequently . \nthere is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o\'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl . \nmichael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . \nin fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . \nunfortunately , every scene about alfred\'s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . \nthe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there\'s a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . \nthere\'s never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . \nthe only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . \neven then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable . \nthe hockey team from hell ?

"b'at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . \nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon\'s parents . \ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \neleven years later , when he\'s established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana\'s brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \nthen , everything ends happily . \nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \nwait a minute , didn\'t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana\'s wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off ! \nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don\'t work . \nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \nironically , though , before the film\'s credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \nleonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting , and acting "" and at-a-glance film reviews called it "" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore "" . \ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! \nwill be forgotten about . \nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \nin fact , my insults don\'t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \n'",0
"b'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nwild wild west \na better name for this movie might\'ve been "" wild wild waste "" . \nwarner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib\'s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . \nbut somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . \nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would\'ve made all the difference- a story writer . \nwild wild west\'s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . \nif warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would\'ve possibly been five times better than what it is . \nheck , ten times . \nas is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he\'s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . \nhere\'s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair . \nthey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . \nas i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . \nbut the acting doesn\'t help either . \nkevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . \nsmith seems to be having a better time as west , although he\'s not nearly as charming as he was in mib . \nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can\'t even stand to look at him or his strange beard . \nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . \nher acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass "" . \ndirector barry sonnenfeld isn\'t of great help either . \neven though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . \nit\'s as if he feels he\'s directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you\'re helming what\'s supposed to be a big-screen hit . \nlast but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . \nat one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline\'s train . \nhe jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it\'s still in motion ! \nalso , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . \nlast but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he\'s not kissing a woman as he\'s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! \nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . \nthe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . \nthere\'s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . \ni would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn\'t possible . \nif the racist and sex jokes don\'t bother you , the performances will . \nif the performances don\'t bother you , the story will . \nif the story doesn\'t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . \nthere\'s no end to the vicious circle . \ngo rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . \nyou\'ll have a better time . \nif you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . \ni bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . . \n'",0
"b'in zoolander , the world\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? "" \nobviously , the film\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\'s model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\'s hoping to use mugatu\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben\'s dad who\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it\'s just because i can\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\'t had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n'",1

"" \nyou know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development . \nthey have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at . \nsylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother\'s funeral . \nhe believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn\'t die from a dwi accident . \ncarter\'s one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid . \nhis face alone is pretty intimidating and there\'s quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice . \nstallone\'s performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn\'t realize he\'s mocking himself . \nthe actual story involves carter\'s investigation into his brother richie\'s death . \nhe\'s in a town that\'s not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well . \nmickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) . \nthere\'s also another plot involving richie\'s mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter\'s still-living relatives . \ni\'m rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible . \ni could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all . \ni don\'t like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally . \nyes , "" get carter "" is just that complicated and complex . \nand what\'s worse is that it\'s not this intricate to make it seem smart like "" the usual suspects "" for example - just the opposite . \nyou get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn\'t remember what had already happened and didn\'t figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax . \nall you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn\'t a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes . \nalthough the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another . \nmaking a movie entirely about criminals doesn\'t necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters . \nmel gibson starred in "" payback "" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn\'t help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter . \nso ultimately "" get carter "" fails for pretty much every selling point it has . \ncarter is not a likable character and you really don\'t care if he gets revenge or not . \nthe action sequences are not at all exciting or original . \nthe enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c\'mon , you know who\'s going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) . \nin the end you don\'t feel nearly satisfied with the results . \nthe filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible . \n * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it\'s seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it\'s always raining . \n'",0
"b""depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \n""",0
"b""i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . \nif there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon . \nthis is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original . \nbut i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . \nyou see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection . \nbut what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ? \nthat is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad . \ni've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much . \nit has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access . \nobviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) . \nthe three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi . \nof the three , only danes has a real character . \nribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes . \nwhen the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations . \nall kinds of good stuff ! \nthe only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments . \nalthough ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance . \nepps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity . \nbut the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting . \na drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . \nclaire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . \nshe could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . \nepps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been . \nthe mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it . \nit's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time . \nnothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for . \nclaire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out . \nthere are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . \ndo not be fooled . \nsome may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare . \n""",0
"b""according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers . \nat the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up . \nten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) . \nhardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) . \ntheir unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed . \nyuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot . \ninstead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally . \nsexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband . \neye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere . \nthe acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine . \nunfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale . \nin the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities . \n ( special note to the profiler fans : ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killer's girlfriend . ) \n""",0
"b'the great actor james woods once said ( and i\'m paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn\'t messy , then you\'re not doing it right "" . \na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" ) . \nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can\'t scare your audience , gross em\' out , if you can\'t do that , make em\' laugh "" . \nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \nit seems that audiences\' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don\'t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \nthese flicks aren\'t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend\'s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it\'s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \nit\'s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \nit\'s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn\'t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man\'s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \nthe film\'s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they\'re coming from inside the house ) . \ni won\'t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \nsad to say , it doesn\'t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \nnow that would be scary . \nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i\'ve ever spent an evening with . \nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can\'t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can\'t stand not getting slaughtered . \n'",0
"b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \nit\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \njohn woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \ntheir romance didn\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\'t convincing . \nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \nwhich explains the film\'s mythic theme . . . as \nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\'s everyone\'s ass . \nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \ncould have lived with it . \nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \nin any case , this is a

"b'if you haven\'t plunked down your hard-earned money yet for "" wild wild west , "" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck\'s frappacino or on a ben & jerry\'s sundae . \nthese treats are great relief from the summer heat . \nin contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . \ni can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . \nthis was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . \nin this film , they are no where to be found . \nwhat remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can-can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . \ntwo men are asked to stop this threat . \none is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . \namong his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . \nthe other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating . \nalthough their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two-man vaudevillian act . \nfor example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . \n "" now touch my breast , "" west says . \ngordon does so and then softly coos his approval . \ni found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . \nthe script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . \ni did enjoy kline\'s reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . \ncould it be that will smith is just so bankable that he\'s not even required to act ? \nit was as if the director was yelling "" will smith , do your own thing . . . and \naction !

"b'i\'m guessing -- and from the available evidence , it\'s not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . \nif so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . \nit has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors\' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee . \nthat left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . \nand you could just smell the disaster brewing . \nif you\'re unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you\'ll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . \nostensibly , it\'s a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) . \nwhen the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called "" an alan smithee film "" -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it . \namong the parties interviewed are the film\'s producer james edmunds ( ryan o\'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them . \nit\'s bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . \nwhat makes it even worse is eszterhas\' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . \nmichael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas\' stock-in-trade . \nthe reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . \nby the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as "" bad a-- "" and "" badder a-- "" , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified . \nthose documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what\'s so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . \nnot content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . \nthe producer is a "" liar "" who "" slept in the white house ; "" the media are "" maggots "" and "" leeches "" working for publications like "" the new york slimes "" and "" newsleak "" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don\'t miss the joke ) . \nit doesn\'t even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation . \nthis is a petulant schoolboy\'s idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . \nthe last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . \nperhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career . \npity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven "" satire "" of excess and ego . \nit\'s too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . \notherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees . \n'",0
"b' "" alcohol and drugs = bad . \nnot alcohol and drugs = good . \ngot it ?

"b' "" i\'d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . \nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . \nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . \nfrom elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . \nwell , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . \ninstead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . \nand arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . \ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . \nwhen in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson\'s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves\'s most powerful scene . \nthe body of the story starts with sonny\'s coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . \nwith his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident\'s dying victims . \nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord\'s work . \nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film\'s director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . \nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love . \nwith a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . \nduvall has every movement down pat . \neven when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . \nhe dances and claps all the way . \nsonny\'s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \n "" i may be on the devil\'s hit-list , but i\'m on god\'s mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . \nand they lap it up . \npeople jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! "" \nand mean it . \nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \nbut sonny is no saint . \nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church\'s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny\'s church , leaving him unemployed . \nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \na man who can\'t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn\'t like recess . "" \nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn\'t seen in a while . \nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn\'t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show\'s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \nalthough it probably couldn\'t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \nand don\'t miss the sweet epilogue during the film\'s closing credits . \na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \n'",1
"b'while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens\' "" blood simple . "" \nboth are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . \nthe body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \nboth films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they\'d accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \nas the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . \na man named hugo moves into the apartment\'s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . \njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \nother than the obvious question of why they don\'t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \ni will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn\'t give away too much of the plot . \nbroadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo\'s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \na police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \ndavid , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \nwhile i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \nthis could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \ngranted , this isn\'t really a "" happy "" ending , but it\'s still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \ni really shouldn\'t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \nyes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i\'d been cheated . \nstill , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \ni guess i just can\'t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . \n'",1

"b""deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . \nthis overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive . \nbut there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . \nbraxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . \ntheir lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket . \nhowever , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables . \nbraxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives . \nbraxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie . \nkennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful . \nthe plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises . \nhowever , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost . \ntake a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . \nthe dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . \nfor example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . \nthere's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . \nthey appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . \nthe characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable . \nnot one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . \nwhat does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? \nwriter-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound . \nbut , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue . \n""",0
"b'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \nedward zwick\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \nyou\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \nthe original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . "" \nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \ni don\'t know if it\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \nit\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\'s development . \nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \nit\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\'ve been getting throughout the year . \nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \nfor example , it\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \nunfortunately , there\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \n'",1

exhibit a : "" days of thunder "" ) , but the reason he\'s not great is because he\'s too technical and calculated . \nhis shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they\'re always making sure you\'re paying attention . \nthis is incredibly annoying , and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . \ndespite never actually becoming great , it\'s never actually boring and it\'s always intriguing . \nwatching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith\'s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . \nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you\'ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith\'s plight without a minute\'s worth of boredom . \n'",1

"b'writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s . \nyes , that\'s right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) . \nnow with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing . \nand guess what ? \nhe succeeds once again ! \nplot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems . \nit isn\'t long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients . \ncritique : this film is not a comedy ! \nit is a drama . \ni say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not . \nit is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there . \nnow on to my review . \nthis movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending . \ni have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he \nmissed ! \nanyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible . \nit\'s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! \nit sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep . \ni\'ve given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks . \nfirst of all , i couldn\'t help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin . \nhe even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit . \nthis kept me interested in watching him at least . \nnumber two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school . \nand god help me if i can\'t get enough of those in an aimless drama . \nand three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson\'s cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person . \na different asshole , but a different person nonetheless . \nif ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won\'t throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ?

\nyou got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . \njason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . \nhe was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he\'s been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \nlisten closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the "" lost ark "" , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) . \nkasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997\'s as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) . \nted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan\'s 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt . \n'",0
"b""filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . \ndoug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . \nin his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . \nbut he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . \nhis movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . \nconsistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . \nthe thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . \nin story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . \nneither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . \n ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) \nthe early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . \nthe characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . \nin fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . \nalthough that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . \ngo doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . \nas far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . \n ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) \nat times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night . \n""",0
"b'ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ? \nit\'s full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . \ni felt the same way watching drowning mona . \nskip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . \nthere are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . \nthere is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo . \neveryone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . \neven the police chief drives one . \nthere is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . \nthere also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . \nit pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . \nit turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . \nthere are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona\'s tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted . \nstill , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . \nthe lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . \neach scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . \nthere\'s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness . \nanyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . \nthe other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . \neach one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization . \nthere is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . \nmona\'s son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . \nchief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . \nthere\'s nothing more to him . \nelle , the chief\'s daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . \nmona\'s husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . \nbob ( affleck ) , elle\'s betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . \nthere is no contrast to any of the characters . \nby having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld\'s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . \nostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona\'s loving manner with everyone on town . \neven that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . \nit\'s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . \nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it\'s ineptitude . \n'",0
"b""in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . \nthe twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . \nafter being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . \nwhen the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone . \nmany poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . \nthat brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . \nhowever , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . \nafter betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . \nuntil that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . \nunfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . \nsometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be . \non the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . \non the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . \nhowever , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . \n""",0
"b""i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze . \ni liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) . \ni typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash . \nwild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen . \nit's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards . \ncriticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic . \nwild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies . \ni must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal . \ni imagine that this shows . \nit's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known . \ni thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here . \ni'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida . \nin blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \nkelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges . \nall of this happens fairly early in the film . \nand right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted . \ni was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked . \nwild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks . \ni remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers . \ni'd give the preview four stars . \nit made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since . \nover the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong . \nthe preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets . \nbut i'm not here to talk about the preview . \ni'm here to talk about denise richards . \nnow , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can . \nof course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and \nflawless body . . . but \ni thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) . \nno , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film . \nthis mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future . \nthe other actors are good , too . \ndillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) . \nbacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer . \nneve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex . \nfor a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived . \nthat's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film . \neach scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist . \nthere isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful . \ni loved it . \n""",1
"b'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\'s protagonist . \nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \nhe\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \nlacrosse knows his killer\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \nit wouldn\'t be fair to reduce everything that\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\'s presence , but it\'s a pretty good place to start . \nthere\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \nit\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \neven without quaid , it doesn\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \nonce the mystery of the killer\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \nin fact , "" stale and predictable "" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \nit\'s too bad stuart wasn\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \ninstead , stuart places his trust in a "" name "" star who can\'t carry the material . \nmaybe next time he\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \n'",0

"b'as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . \ni am befuddled by fight club . \nnow sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later . \nperhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time . \nperhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them . \nfight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former . \nmaybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold . \nbut if it is , i sure don ? t see it . \nedward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer . \nhis insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life . \nbut when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home . \nonce jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally . \nthey begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging . \nas the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days . \ni dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey . \nsuffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation . \nthis is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table . \nbut with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? . \nnow , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today . \nadvertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed . \n ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . ) \nall of them play an important role . \nhow so ? \nwell , i can kinda just tell . \ni can ? t really put my finger on it . \nto say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news . \nis that bad for the world ? \nprobably . \nnot much room for social commentary there . \nwe all know that inter-office politics are just that . . . politics . \nso what was the point of all this ? \nthe film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were . \nall i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting . \n ( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good . \neven meatloaf is good . ) \nwhen you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself . \nnot them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer . \nfight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about . \nbut it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing . \nsure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films . \n'",0

"b'a cinematic version of one of john irving\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of "" simon birch , "" the treatment is merely "" suggested by , "" rather than strictly based on , the book . \nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \nthat\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\'s one that doesn\'t unduly harm the finished product . \nirving\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \n "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice . "" \nsimon believes himself to be "" god\'s instrument , "" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\'s plan . \nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \nsmith\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \nwatching "" simon birch , "" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\'s director and screenwriter . \nfortunately , simon birch isn\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\'s best friend , joe . \nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \nthere\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \nwell , that would be telling . \nperhaps "" suggested by "" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since "" simon birch "" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\'s extraordinary life . \nthe film also changes the book\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\'s lot . \nthe flavor of irving\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \n'",1
"b'numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \n'",0
"b'i admit it . \ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . \nwatching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . \nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . \nand you know they\'ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa\'s elves . \nhe later decks a reindeer . \nhey , man , why don\'t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you\'re at it ? \njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . \narnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . \nwhat can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can\'t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? \narnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . \nhe races from the office to his son\'s karate game , only to find out he missed it . \nand his kid distrusts him because he\'s never around . \n ( gee , we haven\'t seen that in a movie before . ) \narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son\'s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . \nso arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . \nlet me back up for a minute here -- arnold\'s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . \nwatches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin\' turboman sheets . \ni\'d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it\'s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . \nbut nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don\'t recognize him until the last minute . \nthis is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . \nmost painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . \ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . \nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" ) , it\'s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it\'s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . \nmaybe that\'s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine . \n'",0
"b'the catch phrase for disney\'s rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . \n "" it wasn\'t me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . \nwell when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can\'t take all the blame , but he sure can\'t justify himself with his own simple tag line either . \nfred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth . \nas a 30-year-old , fred hasn\'t grown up much , but at least he\'s somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . \nwhen an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . \n . \n . \nfred . \nyes , although he\'s an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn\'t think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known . \nfor the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child\'s play . \nhis passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . \noverbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids\' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . \nfrom here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . \nyou know , standard kid movie material . \nalmost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . \nwe get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . \nwhile he\'s not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he\'s just as unlikeable . \nto say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . \nwhy ? \nbecause while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . \nclassic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . \nstan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him . \npeter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it\'s best . \nwilliams , on the other hand , can\'t garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory . \nas for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . \nthis is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . \ngiving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i\'ll admit to laughing a few times . \nthe amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! \ni must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn\'t crack up over every little thing . \nthen again , maybe they were asleep . \nsome people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren\'t the targeted audience and therefore aren\'t meant to , and won\'t , enjoy them . \nsadly , it\'s also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it\'s presented right . \na two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ? \nand saying that a parent\'s perspective isn\'t important is quite a poor theory to have when they\'re the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place . \n'",0
"b'alchemy is steeped in shades of blue . \nkieslowski\'s blue , that is . \nwith its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers\' new independent film echoes the polish director\'s internationally-acclaimed 1993 release . \nlanguage aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character\'s world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm\'s length . \nas a result , while we\'re able to appreciate the film\'s intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant . \nalchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" . \nwhile there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhen the film opens , she\'s living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her . \nfollowing his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa\'s life is thrown into turmoil . \nevents swirls around her , and she can\'t find a source of stability . \nin her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend\'s mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult . \nalchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues . \nin addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art . \ndoes personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ? \nare artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ? \nmyers\' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context . \nthrough louisa\'s struggles , she succeeds . \nwhile alchemy isn\'t always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination . \neven when we\'re not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there\'s enough material on-screen to hold our attention . \nthe cinematography is stunning . \ncity scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film\'s early portions . \nlater , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we\'re treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground . \nit\'s a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa\'s life as she travels the road back to emotional stability . \nthe title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul . \nand , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it\'s ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace . \nher pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life\'s ultimate goal . \neven though louisa\'s final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it\'s still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch . \nalchemy isn\'t pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it\'s close . \n'",1
"b' "" party camp , "" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i\'ve seen in awhile . \na late rip-off of the "" meatballs "" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \nthat\'s really about all that can be said about the "" plot "" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \nhow fun ! \nsince , "" party camp , "" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \nit\'s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \nat least , then , it wouldn\'t have been such a chore to sit through . \nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn\'t the least bit funny . \nit was groan-inducing . \nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \nso what saves , "" party camp , "" from the dreaded zero star rating ? \nwell , that\'s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy . \n'",0
"b'i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . \ni\'m big fan of perry\'s subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley\'s on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . \nso naturally , when the trailer for "" almost heroes "" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . \na soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley\'s final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry\'s big breakthrough . \ni was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley\'s best , in spite of david spade\'s absence . \ni was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . \nsadly , none of this came to pass . \nthe humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . \nperry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it\'s his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . \nand the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it\'s a farley flick . \nthe movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . \nperry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . \nand farley\'s classic humor is widespread , too . \nalmost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . \nguys , let\'s leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? \nstick to "" tommy boy "" , and we\'ll all be "" friends "" . \n'",0
"b""after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino . \nit's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language . \nluckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer . \nthe story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another . \nshe works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary . \nbut one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope . \njackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation . \nsoon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) . \nalso entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) . \nthe big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands . \nit's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so . \nthere are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters . \nthe funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof . \nthe most interesting relationship is between max and jackie . \na 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ? \nyou've got to commend the acting . \njackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting . \nthe film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes . \ntarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline . \nalso , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear . \njackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath . \nyou can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary . \nthe acting is the glue that holds everything together . \ngrier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character . \nin fact , she's flat-out great . \nanother comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so . \nmichael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge . \nspeaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied . \nthere's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie . \nwhich is a life-saver for mr . tarantino . \nthe story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake . \nbut oh well . \njackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work . \nlet's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us . \n""",1
"b'while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling\'s true genius as a film-maker is casting . \nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn\'s jeff spicoli ; in look who\'s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that\'s more than slightly one-sided . \nthey\'re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling\'s casting . \njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \nthey\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\'t . \nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\' situations pathetic . \nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\'s plot came via jane austen\'s emma ) . \nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\'s no reason to watch them . \npaul isn\'t just a nice guy , he\'s flawless ; consequently , he\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \nhis roommates aren\'t just inconsiderate , they\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \nand professor alcott isn\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \ndora\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\'t explored in sufficient detail . \nthere\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \ni don\'t know . . . \ncomic . \nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\'s "" scarborough fair/canticle . "" \ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist\'s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \nclueless\'s cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul\'s dorm "" hunt\'s hall "" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren\'t those two kids swell ? \n'",0
"b'after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball . \nfiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . \nthere are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . \nthe stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . \nthe astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . \ninterior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . \ninstead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart . \nmission to mars takes it\'s first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done . \nduring these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife . \nit\'s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety . \nthe rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability . \nthere is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time . \nmaybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects . \nit\'s the year 2020 and this is nasa\'s first manned excursion to the red planet . \na crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results . \ngraham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth . \nin response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o\'connell ) . \nobstacles are put in the crew\'s way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them . \ni should say , mcconnell goes about solving them . \ntime and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn\'t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn\'t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable . \n ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew\'s mission and life is in mortal danger . \non a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link . \nwomen serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character\'s personality trait . ) \nby the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush . \nthere is an adage in film to "" show , don\'t tell . "" \nmission to mars does both . \nrepeatedly . \ncharacters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them . \nthe film\'s conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying . \nas i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film . \nthe best i could come up with is pre-teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film\'s components would have been old hat even for them . \ni have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b-movie . \nthe key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material . \ni felt no such earnestness . \n'",0

"b'scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . \nit is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . \nthe mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . \nscream was also known for its self-referential tone . \nmany inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . \nagain , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels .

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \n "" quick , robin ! \nthe anti-shark repellant ! "" \n- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg \ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it\'s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o\'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \nby ivy\'s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \nthe villains\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy\'s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \nakiva goldsman\'s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \nit makes goldsman\'s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i\'d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan\'s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \njoel schumacher\'s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy\'s chosen new abode . \nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \nmr . schumacher\'s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film\'s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \ni think it is - it\'s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" \neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \nmr . schwarzenegger\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! "" \nin the least inventive way . \ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \nchris o\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \nthe film\'s one saving grace ? \nundoubtably uma thurman\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \nms . thurman\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \n ( i\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\'s performance in batman forever . ) \nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\'t a half-bad way to go . \nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \nit\'s been a long time since i\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \n "" at "" , of course , is the operative word . \n'",0

"" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 "" . \n "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit\'s human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i\'ve ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills\' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that\'s seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit\'s the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won\'t give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn\'t , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it\'s not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction "" . \n "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don\'t eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he\'s the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn\'t appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn\'t receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it\'s his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it\'s hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n "" se7en "" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it\'s often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don\'t find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit\'s better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit\'s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren\'t going to cure themselves . \n "" se7en "" raises some tough questions and it\'s intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995\'s "" se7en "" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in "" 12 monkeys "" , spacey in "" the usual suspects "" ( for which he won ) . \n'",1
"b'the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l . a . confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \n "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol\' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn\'t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \noveracted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there\'s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \ndirected by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who\'s the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \nparticularly one . \nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \nnext thing , she cries rape . \nand the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues . \na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin\' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo\'s zany lawyer . \nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \nas ridiculous as it sounds , he\'s the most sane character in the movie . \nthe community is astonished . \nreporters flee to the scene . \nthere\'s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly\'s mother ( theresa russell ) . \nthere\'s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \nlike so many thrillers these days , including "" the usual suspects "" and "" the game , "" "" wild things "" eschews character for plot . \nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he\'s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany "" henry , "" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \ngeorge clinton\'s score is a delight to behold . \nbut it\'s the humans . \nthe characters are mere devices for the "" nasty "" twists . \nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don\'t feel real or we don\'t care for them . \nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \nthe people in "" wild things "" are not so much people as they are caricatures . \nthen there\'s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon\'s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \nironically , the wildest elements of "" wild things "" are not wild at all . \n'",0
"b""i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . \nfor the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . \ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . \nas a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . \nit reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . \nit's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . \nunfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . \nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . \nbut it sure is a fascinating failure . \nmarky . \n . \n . \ner , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . \nhe's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . \nhe works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . \nthey're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . \nthey all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . \nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . \nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . \nwhen they do this , it turns out she is paris' . \n . \n . \ngoddaughter ! \nit's very bad to have paris against you . \nthe story is standard action film stuff . \nit's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \nit's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \nlike i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . \nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . \nand since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \nthey're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . \nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \nit's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \n""",0

"b'for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects . \nbut while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark . \nthe center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . \nhe spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . \nthen , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter . \nraymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie\'s brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing . \nraymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . \nbut these are the least of billy\'s problems . \nbilly is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn\'t seem that he\'ll last much longer . \nbilly and valerie\'s mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond\'s nemesis . \nshe disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it . \nshe merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments . \nif this description seems bleak , i haven\'t told the half of it . \nthis is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it\'s downright depressing . \nwhile at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it\'s not quite worth it . \nthere are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . \ntake for example the extended sequence where one of billy\'s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . \nthe film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything . \ngranted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . \nthe actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles . \nthe good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . \nthe bad thing about an actor turned director is that there\'s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . \na good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . \noldman got it about half right . \n'",0

"b'my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . \ni didn\'t see the first film until much later . \nso looking back , the original didn\'t hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn\'t think too much of it when i initially saw it . \nwatching it now for a second time confirmed that it\'s an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever . \nyou all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before . \nthis first installment does an adequate job with it\'s low budget , but there\'s some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . \nplus the movie\'s ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . \nand does anyone understand what happens to nancy\'s mother at the end of this film ? \ndon\'t get me wrong though . . . \nit\'s not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . \nmost horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . \nhorror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn\'t cut it . \na nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set . \nthe film is presented in both pan and scan and it\'s original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) . \nthe film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix . \nalso included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film\'s director of photography . \nother extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i\'m sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film\'s original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film\'s original theatrical trailer . \nsome dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don\'t have dvd-rom capabilities i can\'t really get into that . \nthe commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular . \nthe first thing of note is that it\'s the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago . \ni\'m not saying that\'s a negative thing , just pointing it out . \neveryone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn\'t say much at all . \nmost of the time you\'ll forget he\'s even there . \neveryone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they\'re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible . \nthe bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series . \nalso included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . . \nhowever you can only access one easily . \nthe other is hidden in what\'s called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created . \nbasically , it\'s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film . \nfinding it though is both a chore and a bore . \n[r] \n'",0

"b'niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse\'s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . \nwild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . \na mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . \nalong the way , true love inevitably blossoms . \nwhat sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette\'s syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . \ntunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year\'s venice film festival . \nto term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney\'s effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy\'s illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . \nshe and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . \ntheir journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . \na detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . \nbut these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney\'s bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved . \n ( opens march 20 ) \n "" i didn\'t know what to expect . \nit\'s like something you chase for so long , but then you don\'t know how to react when you get it . \ni still don\'t know how to react .

"b'seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o\'shea for $5 . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nthe big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \ngluttony is hollywood\'s favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \n "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \nit\'s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \naudiences\' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers\' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it\'s impossible to care about anything that happens . \nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth\'s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it\'s obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments . \nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it\'s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it\'s laughable . \nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \nwe\'re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it\'s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \nit\'s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite . \nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \nbut there\'s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it\'s presented in such a ridiculous way it\'s utterly boring . \nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \n "" lost in space "" is major film production at its worst . \nit\'s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \n'",0
"b'have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? \nor if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? \nthese thought-provoking questions are the subject of "" final destination , "" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999\'s "" the sixth sense . "" \nstylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn\'t use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . \nat the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . \nprogressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom . \n "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself . \nonce seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . \narguing in the airport lobby , alex\'s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . \nas two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . \ncarter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . \nalex\'s best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can\'t because of his fearful parents . \nthe teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . \nonly outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex\'s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . \nthat is only the setup of "" final destination , "" and the less said about what follows , the better . \nsuffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . \nthe setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and "" final destination "" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . \ngraphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don\'t know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . \ndevon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999\'s underseen slasher-comedy , "" idle hands , "" is even more of a charismatic presence here . \nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn\'t meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . \none scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . \nali larter ( 1999\'s "" varsity blues "" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . \nthe other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . \nthe movie is mainly sawa\'s , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . \ntony todd ( 1992\'s "" candyman "" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . \nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . \nultimately , what is so good about "" final destination "" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today\'s horror films . \nif anything , it\'s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again . \n'",1

"b""among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don't help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n""",0
"b'this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i\'ve had for a while . \nwith this film , plus `showgirls\' and `basic instinct\' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors . \nhis celebrated film `total recall\' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws . \nobviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship\' seemed fake . \nbut not everything bad in the film was the director\'s fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors . \nit is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) . \ncasserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school . \nno , they have to pass primary school drama classes first . \nwhile `total\' was written well , `starship\' is purely pathetic . \nall right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you\'re supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) . \nas a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours . \nhalf of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210\' ( dina meyer was in "" beverly hills "" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images . \nthe battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects . \nthere weren\'t even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around . \ni wonder what the insects eat , if there\'s nothing but them on the planets ? \nthere is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended . \nthis type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can\'t see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality . \nbut then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind . \nthe pointless plot begins when johnny\'s ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth . \njohnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents . \nbut there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn\'t better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose . \nand the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid . \nanyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league . \ndizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also . \nthey then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat . \nand guess what ? \nthat\'s about as complex as it gets . \noh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it . \nhe\'s my fifth nom for a razzie . \nthe troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act . \nnaturally , they win , or sort of half-win . \nof course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs . \nthe bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ? \nisn\'t it also amazing that earthlings haven\'t invented better hand-held weapons by then ? \nthe only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero . \nwell , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu\' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) . \n'",0
"b'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has "" cash flow problems . "" \nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\'t seem to put words to paper . \nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\'s block . \nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\'s author . \nironically , that couldn\'t be truer here . \nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\'s name in the credits . \nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\'s theatres . \njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\'t necessarily quality . \nand this certainly isn\'t quality . \nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \n'",0

"" \nthis uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . \nalong the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . \nthe film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . \nliz is everyone\'s favorite because she\'s both beautiful and kind . \nliz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . \nin order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . \nthey then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney\'s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz\'s dead body ) . \ncourtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . \nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \nhowever , an investigation begins into liz\'s death and the film becomes excessively dull . \nthe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \ncourtney\'s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \nfern\'s rise to popularity is equally lame . \nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \nit\'s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school\'s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \nit at least provides us with a look at courtney\'s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn\'t make any sense . \nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz\'s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie\'s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema\'s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . \nthe only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . \nthe costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . \nthey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . \ndirector of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve\'s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . \nshot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . \nperformances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . \nnone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . \nthe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 .

"" \nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \nrounding out the cast includes swingers\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\'s . \nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \nit\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \nthe replacements offers none of this . \n'",0
"b'very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . \nthey are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . \nyou may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . \nin beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . \nbeavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . \nthey live their lives in front of the television . \nthe worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . \nthis happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . \nbeavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . \nthe two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . \neven at this point they have no idea what has happened . \nthey look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . \nbefore the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn\'t realise just how stupid . \nthis is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . \neventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . \nluck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . \nthis man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" . \nbeavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . \nthey are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" . \nto them , this is the best day of their lives . \nnot only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . \ninevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . \noddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . \nthey end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . \nthe irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . \nat old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . \nbeavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives . \nthey even get to meet the president . \nbut all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . \nthis is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it\'s unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . \nthe humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . \nin the end you can\'t help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television . \nin this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . \nif you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . \notherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . \none note of warning : don\'t take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you\'ll \nnever hear the end of it ! \n'",1
"b'how many of us would become strippers ? \nfor those of us who wouldn\'t , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? \nthat\'s probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . \nas you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . \nwould you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? \nin case you haven\'t guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain\'t . \nit\'s actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . \nit is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . \nwhat to do ? \nit hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . \nit seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . \neventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . \nthese include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . \nwhen the sextet is complete , we\'re given a hefty dose of physical comedy . \nwe watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . \nas if there anti-appeal wasn\'t enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising "" the full monty "" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . \n . \n . \nand i mean * all * . \nthe movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . \nit\'s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . \nwith the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . \nthe amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . \nthere\'s a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn\'t be better . \neach character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . \nthe full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could\'ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness . \nit\'s one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . \neither way you see it , it shouldn\'t let you down in the slightest . \nand , pun heavily intended , when it\'s all said and done , you\'ll be smiling from cheek to cheek . \n'",1
"b'jacques tati\'s 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot\'s vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\'s vacation . \nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\'t watch where they\'re going . \nin "" les vacances de m . hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \ntati doesn\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\'s expectations , and "" les vacances de m . hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he\'s not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does . \nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\'s lights coming on one by one . \nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \n "" les vacances de m . hulot "" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \nnote : "" les vacances de m . hulot "" was not rated by the mpaa . \nit would at most receive a pg rating . \n'",1
"b'making your first feature film ain\'t easy . \nassemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you\'re already ahead of the game . \nbut rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film . \nhow many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ? \nthe enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it . \nagain . \nfive irish kids in nyc\'s hell\'s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop . \nwith teary music . \nand slow motion . \nin the film\'s first scene . \nthe kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen . \nleading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante . \ni\'d like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points . \nhe\'s concerned about buddy jason gedrick\'s heroin abuse . \nhe sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin\'s character\'s sister . \nhe looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) . \nbut none of this ever really amounts to anything . \nit seems that moresco\'s greater concern is to provide that intangible "" slice of life "" , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone\'s been trying to evoke since scorsese\'s early work . \nso , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other . \n ( do people actually do this ! ? ) \nwe get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not . \nwe also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose . \nbruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you\'ve seen in movies just like this one before . \nassante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin\'s performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it\'s almost funny . \nmoresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal . \nas a result , the movie\'s style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down . \nnearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us . \nwith slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we don\'t comprehend the link to the past . \nmoresco needs to either trust his audience\'s intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it . \nhis next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety . \nif he actually gets that chance . \nreviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) . \n'",0

"b'renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . \nthe film follows potter\'s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . \nhe also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort . "" \nthe tale has resnais\'s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . \nit is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone\'s heart for every occasion . \nwhat hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . \nyet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . \nalso , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . \nit also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . \nit tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . \nthey are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . \nshe is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . \nshe once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . \nsimon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . \nsimon\'s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . \nscreenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . \njaoui\'s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . \nin history , using for her thesis the study of \'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . \' \nshe works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control . \non her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . \nto his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister\'s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he\'s so sensitive . \nbacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . \nhe is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . \nodile still pines for him , but he\'s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . \nlove is \'the same old song\' that makes the world go \'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . \neverything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile\'s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . \nthere\'s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . \nthis film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . \nit not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . \nit is also interesting in the way it examines its characters\' behavior as being similar in business as in love . \n'",1

"b' "" ladybugs "" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . \nthis picture doesn\'t play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ? \nand why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? \nrodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . \nhe obviously doesn\'t have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company\'s girls\' soccer team . \nwhat a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . \ni didn\'t laugh , but for some reason it didn\'t annoy me that much . \nchester\'s fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams . \njonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) . \nwhat we get is just another retread of the "" underdog sports team "" mixed with some cross dressing . \nunfortunately , the film isn\'t smart enough to play upon the drag aspect . \nin fact , it downplays it so heavily it\'s totally unbelievable . \ncould it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? \nhe only wears a girl\'s wig , without any makeup , and they don\'t even give him falsies . \nbrandis doesn\'t bother to mimic a girl\'s voice either . \nthen there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ? \nmartha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ? \njust when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . \nwhen bess discovers what\'s really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . \nthis film could\'ve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . \nthere\'s just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters . \ni\'ve seen worse movies than "" ladybugs , "" but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn\'t seem as bad as it is . \ndangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price . \n'",0

\nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n'",1

"" ) , the alienated writer , who\'s been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . \nnow that she\'s broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he\'s written declaring his "" love "" for her in the hopes he\'ll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even \nthough he\'s leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . \nsince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn\'t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it\'s a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after "" dick tracy "" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who\'s humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don\'t ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . \nugh . \nthe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not "" american grafitti "" or "" dazed and confused , "" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably "" sixteen candles . "" \nthe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . \nthis film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and \nthen says that it\'s all okay . \nwe can\'t take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? \nbut i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it\'s like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . \ngenerally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . \ni actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . \nand , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . \nhowever , the character of denise really doesn\'t work with the film , when really thought about . \nshe\'s far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . \nshe\'s not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she\'s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . \nshe may ruin the film more , but at least when she\'s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves "" well , at least we\'ll be entertained . "" \na couple other things that just don\'t work : mike\'s character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn\'t work at all : jenna eflman\'s uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn\'t work , but nice try . \nbasically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i\'m giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we\'d do . \nwe don\'t feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren\'t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . \nthe acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it\'s portraying ? \nthe answer for this film is no . \nnice try , though . \n'",0

"b'not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . \nlike bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters\' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . \nalso like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters\' ravished and wracked faces . \nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman\'s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . \nall that is missing is a discussion of god . \nwhich is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . \nin fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . \nnonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film\'s rhythms . \nonce the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . \none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . \nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergman\'s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple\'s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all . \nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . \nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . \nit is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . \nmuch has been made of brenda blethyn\'s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . \nthere are a few missteps . \nfor one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . \nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . \nand occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . \nfor all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . \nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . \nin fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . \nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the film\'s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . \nnonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . \nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . \nneedless to say , it is also very depressing at times . \nbut for many of us , of course , so is life . \nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . \n'",1
"b'originally entitled dancing about architecture ( i . e . \n "" talking about love is like dancing about architecture "" ) , but changed because it sounded too much like the recent box-office dud dancing at lughnasa , this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names , playing interesting and well-written characters , within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la robert altman . \nplot : follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love , finding themselves , regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are , and who they want , and appreciating the fine emotional art of love . \ncritique : charmingly effective romantic drama , this film offers insight into various types of relationships , presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast , and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties . \nhow do people fall in love ?

"b'what hath kevin williamson wrought ? \nwhile the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . \nthose williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ . \nadd to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy . \nthe influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas . \nfirst , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling . \nthis sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer\'s look . \ndressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , \nsans the hook . \none thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise . \nstudents at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of "" mythology "" passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness . \nit hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn\'t ) . \nmichelle , slain by the "" killer lurking in the backseat "" of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well . \nthe setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares . \ntoo many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film\'s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door . \nbut that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there\'s also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre . \nbanks and horta\'s ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor . \nsome laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i\'m not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . \nthe filmmakers don\'t get much help from their onscreen talent . \ni was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ \nstarlet jennifer love hewitt , but i\'d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto . \n_dawson\'s_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor . \ngranted , the cast is hampered by their material . \nloretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard . \nthe recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive . \nif other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers\' many victims . \n'",0
"b""what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . \nsometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking . \nthe thin red line is flawed but it provokes . \nterence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . \nunlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . \nwhile that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . \nsaving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . \none message is not necessarily more correct than the other . \nit just depends on one's point of view . \nin malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush . \nthe setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? \nin saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . \nin the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . \nthey are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . \nall that separates them is war . \nthe flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs . \nunbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . \ndispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . \ninstead , he gets distracting self-consciousness . \naside from that , malick's direction is stunning . \nthe tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . \nsean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . \npenn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . \njohn travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . \nultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . \nit has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . \nhas no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? \nwhat malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking . \n""",1

\nwell , this wouldn\'t be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie . \nhere\'s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm "" . . . \nfirst thing--if you don\'t heed my advice , then understand what you\'re about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud . \nit\'s not easy to watch . \ni didn\'t know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . \nthe ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . \na rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband\'s safe . \nshe calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn\'t it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead . \nshe\'s horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find . \nfamily-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder "" . \nlet me backtrack for a moment . \nsee , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . \nhowever , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference . \nvery sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies . \nthe thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i\'ll swallow my bile and move on . \nwelles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . \nyou\'d think he\'s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! \nhe comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . \nafter a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films . \nskip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . . \nled by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue . \nthe movie doesn\'t end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante . \nthis film doesn\'t draw you in . \nit keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? \nit is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \n "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . \nby those jabs , i\'m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment . \nfor a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . \na good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . \nwriter andrew kevin walker didn\'t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \'95s twisted thriller , "" se7en "" . \ndirector schumacher doesn\'t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don\'t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . \nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don\'t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it\'s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . \nhowever , gratuitous is joel\'s middle name . \nhe must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . \nno , he doesn\'t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . \nhe doesn\'t leave much to the imagination . \nit\'s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . \nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) \ncraft . \ncase in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) \ndrives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . \nsee . . . no \nsubtlety . \ndoes joel think we\'re stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? \nwho do we root for in this mess ? \nis there anybody out there ? \nit\'s not all the director\'s fault , though . \nwhy did the actors sign up for this ? \nnicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin\' out loud ! \nif he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? \nwhat is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ? \nvillainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . \nand what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? \nhe was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action "" . \ni guess ol\' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or \nthey\'re suckers . \nor they just don\'t care . \nthere are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . \ncatherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . \nbaby cindy is obviously cute and wells\' devout love of his daughter is sweet . \nthe mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . \nthis film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like "" payback "" ( which was a much better movie ) . \nthe editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it\'s rough . \nduring some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren\'t good and whose timing was a half-second off . \nsuch a technical error indeed stands out . \nspeaking of standing out , don\'t believe the misleading trailers . \nthere\'s not much action here . \noccasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . \nafter seeing "" 8mm "" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again . \nis that a positive ? \nwell , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they\'ve done a swell job here . \nit\'ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . \nbut today i\'m not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? \ni\'m sure that somewhere right now there\'s some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn\'t mean i need to know about it . \nyes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there . \nyes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn\'t look like we expect him to . \nyou said all that in 1995 . \nmove on . \nthis film serves no purpose . \nit doesn\'t entertain , it doesn\'t teach us anything , it doesn\'t make a statement beyond the obvious "" this stuff is bad "" approach . \nonly if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile . \nthat\'s not likely to happen , though , so "" 8mm "" is indeed a scummy waste of money . \norson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , "" to movies . . . to \ngood movies "" . \nif only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . \nlike "" snuff "" films , "" 8mm "" should never have been made . \nnow , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . \nuseless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme . \nhe used it in "" batman forever "" , in "" batman & robin "" , in "" a time to kill "" , in "" falling down "" , and it\'s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . . \n'",0
"b'go\'s is a gloriously slick hip machine . \ndirector liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . \nafter more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . \nthis is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn\'t arrive . \na la tarantino\'s pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . \nthe basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . \nher co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . \nzack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . \nperhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino\'s non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ; \npulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go\'s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . \ntorontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was "" not pleased with "" her turn as the ill-fated cashier . \nin go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date . \nhere\'s an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . \nif she doesn\'t want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said "" no , "" not go . \nbut i digress . \ngo is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can\'t help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . \nin that sense , it\'s a departure from liman\'s last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan\'s trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story\'s clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald\'s for their latest commercial ) . \ni wish i cared more about go\'s characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . \nwhen the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . \nyet entertain me it did . \ngo is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . \nfichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . \nunlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable . \n'",1
"b""capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived . \nthis one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . . \nextended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts . \nbeautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep . \nthis is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson . \ninstead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat . \nnot a good choice . \nwhile the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare . \nthe acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director's style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters . \na . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion . \ni could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on . \nbut by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping . \napparantly , everybody can now fly . \nhell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly . \nbetter jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess . \nin short , they should have gotten paul anderson back . \nor at least let robin shou direct . . . \nb . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad . \ni counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious . \nhad this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking . \nbut in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished . \nc . ) now for the _really_ bad parts . \ni admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series . \nthe games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger . \nthe first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride . \nthis could have been a really cool movie . \nit isn't . \nthe writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers . \nsome of the plot elements are just plain stupid . \nhow stupid ? \ntake , for instance , how our heroes move around . \nthey use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh \nboy . . . \neven worse is the treatment of secondary characters . \nblink and you'll miss 'em . \nmost characters had more depth in the video games . \nif you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet . \na good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about . \nthere's no explanation at all for this . \nand for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended . \nit almost made me weep . \nto sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes . \n""",0
"b'did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ? \nor if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ? \ni used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . \nbut after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . \nas the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . \nthe men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . \nbased in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . \nbut to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . \nthey carry other-worldly technology to erase people\'s short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action . \nand their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids . \nlittle do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space . \none of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . \nit holds the \'key\' , literally , to universal peace . \na giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this \'key\' . \nin the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? \nmandibles ? \ntentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . \ntherefore , it must be recovered and returned to it\'s rightful owners . \notherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the \'key\' . \nnow , it\'s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . \nthe mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones . \nhe is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . \nthe stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes . \nhe is accompanied by a flippant rookie , "" j "" , played by will smith . \nbut , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie . \nand , this isn\'t an independence day knockoff . \nrather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . \nbut to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario . \nyet , this movie is very appealing . \nthe abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who \'lives\' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . \nit gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . \njones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity . \nsmith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones\' straight man routine . \nthey click like dorothy\'s ruby red shoes . \nthe look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam\'s family ) . \nthis guy has a knack for \'gothic\' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . \nand , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors . \nthe story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! \nthe result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . \nlet the men in black protect and color your world . \n'",1
"b'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \nit\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\' 1988 film wings of desire . \ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\'t a rip-off of its source material . \nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \nthat\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . "" \n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \nsince i love this film so much , i\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\'t perfect . \nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \nhe\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \nhe\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n'",1
"b'the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam . \n ( fitting , since the media-saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment . ) \nwhile driving through a long , flat iraqi desert ( in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament ) , one of the men under special forces sgt . \nmaj . archie gates\' ( who\'s steering ) command requests a beach boys tune . \nthese men want their apocalypse now moment , only instead of surfing , they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle , armed with automatic rifles . \nour three kings ( okay , four ) are good fighters , but they don\'t necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it\'s a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . \nthey are gates , new father sgt . \ntroy barlow ( wahlberg ) , sgt . \nchief elgin ( cube ) , and pvt . \nconrad vig ( music video director jonze ) . \nat story\'s start , president bush has declared a ceasefire , and american troops are tying up loose ends . \nbarlow , elgin , and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an "" ass-map "" that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion . \ngates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation ; he proposes-demands-that barlow , elgin , and vig join him on a treasure hunt . \nditching his escort , a relentless reporter named adriana cruz ( nora dunn ) , is easy . \nso is finding the treasure , until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq : saddam\'s men are threatening the dictator\'s detractors ( citizens of his own country ) with violence . \nwhen gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck , ready to loot , the unarmed rebels want help . \n ( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . ) \ngates convinces the vault\'s guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck . \nthe situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges . \nbut the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces . \nthe result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . \nbarlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . \nhis interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child . \n ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . ) \ni liked these scenes best , because the political became personal . \nit\'s one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it\'s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib . \nrussell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man\'s affair with his bedridden mother . \n ( it\'s great . ) \nhis second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish . \none could argue that it\'s easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence . \nwhen barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we\'re paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast . \nthree kings is russell\'s first visually arresting picture . \nstylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas . \nnewton thomas sigel\'s cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate . \none practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen . \n ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it\'s like having sand in your eyes . "" ) \nthis also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade . \n ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . ) \nrussell throws plenty at sigel\'s camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell\'s previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film\'s most realistic , even the most poignant . \n ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . ) \nif anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us . \nits climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell . \nsubsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow\'s post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status . \n ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . ) \nclooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , "" let my people go !

"b""girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . \ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . \nthere was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . \nif there was a point to the film , i missed it . \ngirl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . \nthe plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . \nshe begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . \nalso , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . \nhe is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . \nher neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . \nhe also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . \nthe soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . \nit kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . \nfor parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . \nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . \nof course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . \nprince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . \nof the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . \nhe was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . \nhe should have stuck to acting in this film . \nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . \nthere are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . \nin that film , they worked to propel the narrative . \nin this film , they just made me more confused . \nthere are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . \nother than that , though , nothing much happens . \nthere are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . \ni'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . \nin girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . \nhe had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . \ngirl 6 earns a grade of d . \n""",0
"b'the most absurd remake of 1998 ? \nit\'s a toss up between gus van sant\'s psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . \n ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) \nthere is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . \n ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) \nand while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it\'s also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . \ntheron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . \nthat baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . \nenter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . \njoe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe\'s demise . \nsuffice it to say , the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city . "" \ntheron ( so good in devil\'s advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . \nthe plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg\'s the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , "" look , joe\'s headed for the movie theatre !

"b'a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today\'s youth seem attracted to black culture . \nthe review \nif black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . \nhowever , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . \nblack & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america\'s youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . \nfeaturing a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback\'s is a complex film worth seeing . \nblack & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . \nthere is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . \nthis eventually spills over into the life of dean\'s long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . \nrich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . \nmeanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . \nothers who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean\'s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . \nmike tyson . \nthe stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . \nfriendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . \noriginally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . \nwhile the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . \nthe three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . \nthe frequent sex is one of the film\'s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . \nto toback\'s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . \nthese gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . \nwhenever a character finds himself on donager\'s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . \ncharlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i\'ll be way over this . "" \nthese youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . \ntoback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . \nmost of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film\'s comic relief without really trying . \nhe is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson\'s image as a dimwit . \nbut tyson also gets the film\'s scariest moment . \nas he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . \nthe scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . \nthe reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr\'s face turns a frightening shade of purple . \nblack & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film\'s omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . \nbut toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character\'s struggle . \nthus black & white\'s message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . \ntoback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . \nand we do . \n'",1
"b""synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . \nif she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . \ntraining , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . \nthrow in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . \nreview : the title of this movie turned me off at first . \ni mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? \nthe other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned . \ni went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . \nto my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . \nmoore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . \nthe storyline is simple . \nanne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \ntraining . \njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \nnonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \njordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . \nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \nroyce ( what is his surname ? \ndo we care ? ) \nalmost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . \ni still liked it though . \nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \nas we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \nthis is an individual's fight for self-advancement . \nwe don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . \nit's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not . \n""",1
"b'five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king\'s writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . \nunlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . \nplot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . \ncritique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "" evil "" characters . \nits only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . \nthe real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . \nof course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . \nand let\'s not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . \nam i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? \nor even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat\'s ass about anyone in this film ? \nwell , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . \nfurthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone\'s life to present this story . \nin fact , the story is empty within itself . \ni truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . \nwow . \nhow interesting . \nthe plot\'s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . \nwhip out those thinking caps , kids ! \nhmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . \nhmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . \nwhat a crock ! \ni am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . \nin fact , it was one big bore . \ni didn\'t see the point of the movie , i didn\'t see the point of the story and i certainly didn\'t see the point in tom hanks\' big double-chin . \nall in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . \ngive that man an award or something ! \n'",0

"b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \nthe movie\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" . \na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\'t funny , nor believable . \nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \nif you can\'t , don\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \n'",0
"b' "" first rule of fight club is , don\'t talk about fight club . "" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it\'s not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i\'m surprised i didn\'t walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit\'s very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it\'s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser\'s attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn\'t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won\'t do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i\'m afraid that immature men might respond to the film\'s violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i\'m just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou\'ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid .

"b""forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n""",0

"b'i am a steven seagal fan . \ni only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\'s been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \nhe\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\'t broke , why fix it ? \n ( more on this disappointed person\'s dashed expectations later ) . \nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing . \nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \nit\'s the other changes that disappoint . \nfor example , although there\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\'s "" in living colour . "" \nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \ntoo much . \nseagal\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \nthat\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \nwe trusted him . \nwe got to know him . \nnow , betrayal . \ni don\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\'s going to try to be funny again . \ni\'ll try , but it won\'t be easy . \nif you haven\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \nit\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \nafter all , if we can\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \nmufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . \neverybody makes mistakes once in awhile . \n'",0
"b' "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year . \nit has to be . \nthe other prospect is just too horrifying to consider . \nbad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand . \nis it as bad as advertised ? \noh yes , very much so . \nthe plot is incomprehensible . \nthe acting is atrocious . \nthe special effects are mediocre . \nthe action is dull . \nthe implausibilities are legion . \nthe dialogue is cringe-inducing . \nthe whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . \ni don\'t even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i\'d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : \nthe premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . \nthe year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . \nonly a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . \none man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . \nthere he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . \npressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . \nmeanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he\'s stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man\'s daughter . \nhe decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . \n . \n . ) \nso the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can\'t go . \nterl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . \nof course , his plan doesn\'t work . \nso many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? \nhow about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard\'s sci-fi novel ? \nearly previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? "" \nthe movie did nothing to stem such remarks . \nall that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . \nof course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary . \nthe psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don\'t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees . \n ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you\'re not ! \nfwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" ) \nit\'s no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he\'s an idiot . \nhe breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book . \nhe underestimates his enemies , assuming he\'ll win just because he\'s smarter . \n ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra . ) \nnot content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos\' language and technology . \n ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) \nhe then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . \nno wonder this guy never got his promotion . \nthe plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . \nwhy do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? \nhow come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? \nhow in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? \nand how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? \nthere\'s a whole lot more to scratch one\'s head about in "" battlefield earth . "" \nbring a scorecard to track the plot holes . \ndirector roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason . \nall the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it\'s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . \nthe action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement . \nare these things really so hard to construct ? \nmy respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot . \nthis movie is an absolute headache . \nit\'s not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense . \nfor most of "" battlefield earth\'s "" running time , i just didn\'t know what was happening . \nit didn\'t have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on . \nwhen i pieced the plot together later , it didn\'t look any better . \nhere\'s how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it\'s going to take something really , really inept to top it . \nthe only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it . \nin fact , i\'d think that hubbard\'s cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible . \nthat\'ll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again . \n'",0
"b'a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold \'yawn\' . \nfollowed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer . \nthen i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see . \nwell , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here . \n\'here\' , of course , was still three months away . \ni\'ll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . \ni\'d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list . \nthat , let me tell you , has changed completely . \ni knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet . \nthe acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick . \nseriously . \ni\'ve never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry , \nmake that \'roles\' in the movie . \neven travolta\'s great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage\'s character portrayals . \nmy favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler\'s hideout . \nhalf drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son\'s death from castor\'s perspective - "" doesn\'t it just break your heart . "" he mutters coldly . \nnow don\'t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it\'s not . \nthat\'s what really makes this movie unique . \nit\'s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all . \nsuspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that\'s \nthe only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and \nnever hit . \nseveral action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press \'rewind\' and watch it over again . \nthe part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant . \nwhilst cage\'s and travolta\'s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing . \njoan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer\'s long suffering wife . \ni like the fact that her character didn\'t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it \nwould have wrecked her potrayal . \ngina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy\'s mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy\'s mistreated girlfriends . \nother movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a \nsex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent . \ndominique swain , who plays archer\'s daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen\'s or gershon\'s . \nfaults ? well . . . there were some i have to say . \nfirst , the movie\'s ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it\'s own good . \nafter the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can\'t help but think - "" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? "" . \nthere were certain bits that weren\'t handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice . \noverall , this movie was not perfect . \nbut i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . \nmany critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i \ncertainly hope so . \n'",1
"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\'t ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\'s a catch -- he\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\'s now infected with alien dna . \npatrick\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\'s primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here . "" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful . "" \nand she\'s not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he\'s going to rape her . "" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( "" he\'s in aisle 1 ! "" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\'s brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\'s being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that "" she\'s so empowered . "" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\'s * what i call empowerment . \n'",0
"b'there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it\'s just that none of them happen to be actors . \nthe stars i\'m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie\'s "" outer space "" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . \nyes , in terms of acting , the star power is . \n . \n . \nwell , more like a falling star . \nkinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . \nlost in space , as if you really didn\'t know , is based on the 60\'s sci-fi television series of the same name . \nit\'s the year 2058 , and earth\'s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . \njohn robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . \nearth\'s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john\'s family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . \njohn\'s family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . \ndespite everyone\'s reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . \nunknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . \ndr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to "" destroy robinson family "" ! \nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . \nas for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . \nit\'s hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? \nchabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . \nif you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you\'re wrong ! \nthat\'s just her normal voice ! \nin yet another example of a "" friend "" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . \ngraham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . \nhurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . \nif hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . \njohnson isn\'t dull , he\'s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody\'s ass all the time . \nwant an example of how cool this kid can be ? \nhow about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? \nhey , don\'t laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . \nbut alas , if you thought a character couldn\'t be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . \nwhy hire an actress ? \nthey could\'ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . \nnow that would\'ve had some pizzazz ! \nlost in space luckily doesn\'t suffer in every single category that it could have . \nthe special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . \nunfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . \nwhile the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn\'t find in most modern sci-fi films . \ncontact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . \nlost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you\'d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . \nthen again , with an ending like this film has , it\'s obvious a sequel is already being considered . \nwhat an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . \nthe attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . \nwell , danger potential movie goers ! \ndanger ! \nthis movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . \n'",0
"b'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" . \nthen it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly "" . \nthen , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s "" the pines of rome "" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s "" rhapsody in blue "" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s "" the steadfast tin soldier "" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer\'s apprentice "" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\'s "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney

"b'for "" original sin , "" the road to the screen has been rocky . \ninitially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . \nadvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . \nso is "" original sin "" really all that bad ? \nyes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . \nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" ) . \nmore importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . \nveteran readers know that , as a rule , i don\'t encourage people to patronize lousy films . \nmost of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the "" let\'s go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . \nbut things are different this summer . \nquality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i\'m concerned , it\'s fair to find our kicks where we may . \n "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls , "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it\'ll do until something worse comes along . \nthe film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , "" mississippi mermaid "" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie\'s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . \nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , "" this is not a love story , it is a story about love .

"" \nafter their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . \njolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers\' insistence on using one of banderas\' legs to cover jolie\'s crotch makes it look like he\'s trying to climb her . \nluis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . \nhis blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . \nluis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . \nshortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . \nfinally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . \nincidentally , if you\'re afraid i\'m giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . \nalong the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie "" 61 * "" ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman\'s sister to find out what happened to the real julia . \nluis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can\'t have her , he will kill her . \noh , the pathos of it all . \nthe cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . \nbanderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . \nas for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . \nhis most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . \nif anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . \nand if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them "" original sin .

"b'the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" . \nso i didn\'t expect too much from this . \nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \nactually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . \nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \nis that exciting or what ? \nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\'t have to be bad . \nit\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \'\' by shirley jackson . \na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \n "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \nand with a $70 mill . \nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \nbut why give him a more serious material ? \nin the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\'s career as a director . \nyet it wouldn\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \nbut this is where the good things end . \nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \nit\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\'t engage . \nat first you do not know what\'s going on . \nis this part of the experiment ? \nare these hallucinations ? \nprojections of the subconscience ? \nparanoia ? \nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \nthe house is actually possessed . \nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\'s what i got ? \ni believe hichock once said that "" it\'s better to wait for a climax , than to see one "" . \nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \nthey are impossible to take seriously . \nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\'s "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless . \n "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \n "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" . \n'",0
"b""out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n""",0
"b""suicide is pointless , everyone should know that . \nso what's this movie like ? \nyou guessed it . . . \npointless . \nthe virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them . \nwhen the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever . \nthat's what the press materials for the film probably say . \nnow here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time . \nboring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . . \nwell as committing suicide . \nthe movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window . \nthe girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on . \nthen , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on . \nis that a joke ? \nis that supposed to be amusing in some way ? \nfrom then on , the movie failed to draw me back in . \nperformances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides . \nwoods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well . \ndunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well . \nand while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed . \nthere are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more . \nas a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . . \nwell since eddie and the cruisers ) . \nperhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters . \nwe never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling . \nall we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash . \nwhat mother doesn't ? \nit's certainly no reason to commit suicide . \nwith the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera . \nwith the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either . \nhaving family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies . \nso attention film directors . . . \nstop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry . \njust because they share your dna doesn't mean they share your talent . \n[r] \n""",0
"b""the question isn't why has grease been reissued . \nthe answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity . \nno , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ? \nthe answer is not an easy one . \ngrease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era . \nthe music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited . \ntravolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening . \nbut grease didn't break any new cinematic ground . \nit was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider . \nwhat grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history . \nok , let's not be a spoilsport . \ngrease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers . \nit's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career . \nhe could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly . \ncinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur . \nbetween grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand . \ntwo reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded . \ntoday , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen . \ntoday's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed . \nsecondly , a lack of talent . \nperformers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone . \nmost singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts . \na good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world . \nhe danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles . \nso , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose . \nif audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals . \nperhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years . \nat one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna . \nso , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals . \nlet grease be the word that sparks this revival . \n""",1
"b'one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . \nsuch was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . \nmade in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan . \nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . \nbut , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . \nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . \ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . \nduring one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . \nafter she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh\'s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . \nshe is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . \napart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn\'t got anything in common with the works of director\'s more talented father . \ndespite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . \njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . \nthe actors aren\'t good either . \njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn\'t suit him . \nbill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena\'s boyfriend . \nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn\'t help this film . \nthe screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer\'s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . \none of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh\'s "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . \nthe twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . \nall in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger\'s career . \n'",0

"b""wow ! what a movie . \nit's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don't . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n""",1

"b'playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare\'s works . \nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn\'t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \nand , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \nit\'s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \nit could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you\'ve ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it\'s likely that you\'ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \njoseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he\'s a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life\'s more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \nhe\'s commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \nshakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \nhe begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \nthis all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . \nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . \nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeare\'s writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he\'s clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene . \nfiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i\'ve seen her in . \nthe two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . \nof course , it doesn\'t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \nstoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \ndirector john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \ni\'m going to have to see the movie again ; i\'m certain there are numerous references that i missed . \nin fact , i doubt it\'s possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \nstoppard is a master of detail : you\'ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \nthere\'s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe\'s mysterious death in a pub . \nthere\'s also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \n "" there\'s no dog in this play ? "" \n "" no ! \nno dog ! "" \nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . \ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . \nben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow\'s ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . \ncolin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . \njudi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . \nmy single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . \nthe story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . \nbut my quibbling is not important . \nwhat is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . \nshakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it\'s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . \nit\'s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare\'s work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . \ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . \nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . \n'",1

"b'one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar\'s ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it\'s only when things are over that they make sense .

"" \nand "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? \' \nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you\'re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \nit\'s an embarrassment . \ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn\'t used . \nthere are a few of each , but they\'re all token attempts . \nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \nthis is not what i wanted to see . \ni didn\'t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \nthere isn\'t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \nfirst of all , we don\'t learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \nnot one thing . \nwhat was his life like before this film ? \nwell , i imagine he didn\'t have one . \nthat\'s why he feels like a plot device . \nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\'s recently retired from film ( i don\'t blame him , honestly ) . \nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\'ve ever had to endure , but he\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \ni\'ve seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas , "" but the phantom menace is the first one i\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \ni can\'t say that i didn\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \ncan\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \nand then there\'s the question of magic . \nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \njohn williams\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\' direction . \ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \nmine weren\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \ni don\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\'t . \nit\'s here to stay . \ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \n'",0

"" \nyou may ask . \nwell , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie . \nblade squad is dumb . \nblade squad is loud . \nblade squad is obnoxious . \nblade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series . \nwhy not ? \nafter all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past . \nso , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ? \nto be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable . \nthe film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested . \ni\'d imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it . \ni tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad . \ni can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 . \nand , although this isn\'t saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book\'s terrific two-year beginning ) . \nbut , i digress . \ndespite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series . \none , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer\'s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background . \noh yeah , dylan\'s "" knockin\' on heaven\'s door "" and bowie\'s "" i\'m afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste . \ntwo , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound . \nthe substandard sound editing irritated me to no end . \ncharacters\' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible . \nduring one important scene , a song played loudly in the background . \nwhen a character spoke , the song\'s volume dropped but did not disappear . \nas soon as that character finished speaking , the song\'s volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke . \nthis sounds trivial , i\'m sure , but it distracted me immensely . \nfinally , this is commercial television . \nfoul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television . \nthus , don\'t use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner . \nin an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets . \nwhen the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car\'s horn off-screen to muffle the word out . \nin a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably . \nperhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics\' 2099 series of comics . \nmake up a bunch of new bad words for the future . \nthis way , you don\'t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language . \ncompared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp . \nwhen compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs . \n ( review written august 12 , 1998 ) \n'",0

"" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . \nwelcome to the club , scott kalvert . \nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . \ndicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . \nas the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . \none night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . \njim\'s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . \nalong with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . \nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . \nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll\'s posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . \nas a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long "" just say no "" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . \njim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . \nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those "" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd "" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . \nwithout a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . \ndirector scott kalvert doesn\'t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . \non only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . \nmostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . \nthey also don\'t allow leonardo dicaprio\'s performance to be as strong as it could have been . \nfor every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . \ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won\'t let character interaction define this story . \nhe wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . \nat isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio\'s talents . \nfar more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . \n'",0
"b""every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed . \nmost of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings . \nbut , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons . \ni love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review . \nthe impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . \nwhich surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show wasn't late and i didn't lack sleep before the show . \nsuch things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself . \nthe plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) . \ntwo of them are assigned to cover the train collision . \nas soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other . \nthe plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d' ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn . \nmovie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts . \nhowever , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest . \nit probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers . \nshyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable . \nthe end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again . \ni'll give it the benefit of the doubt , though . \n""",0
"b'us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren\'t thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions . \nif the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . \nthe film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer\'s kids . \ndoc tells marty he must take his son\'s place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . \nwhoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn\'t joking , especially when it comes to the movies . \nessentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it\'s not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . \nat the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything\'s copasetic right ? \nwrong . \nsince when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ? \nthere are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won\'t even bother to list them all . \nbasically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . \nthe films\' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . \nit\'s difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . \nthe only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . \ninstead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . \nby the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn\'t seem gratuitous . \n "" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie . \nit certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . \n'",1

"b'for a movie about disco-era excess , "" 54 "" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . \nthink of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , "" 54 "" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . \nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . \nin fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , "" 54 "" would be about as feathery as the time period\'s popular female hairstyle . \nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . \ninside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . \nthe film\'s fictional main character is shane o\'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club\'s velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . \nhis wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in \'79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . \nonce inside , shane becomes seduced by the club\'s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . \nhe has such a good time that he doesn\'t want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . \nhe quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg\'s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . \nafter rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . \nbut fame doesn\'t come without a price . \n "" 54 "" \'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . \nalleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since "" 54 "" sometimes feels like it\'s missing a scene here or there . \nnowhere is this more apparent than in shane\'s relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he\'s long admired from afar . \nthe romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . \nthat "" 54 "" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it\'s assembled . \nsure , it\'s shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we\'ve seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . \nthe film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( "" the wedding singer "" \'s ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54\'s closed doors and asks for a "" funky little treat . "" \nthe solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you\'re caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . \nnewcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it\'s a shame their subplot goes nowhere . \nmeyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in "" clueless "" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , "" one , two , three , attitude ! "" \nsherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big \'70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left "" er "" as rubell\'s accountant , but she\'s criminally underused . \nas the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone . \nwhen he\'s not playing the life of the party , the ex- "" saturday night live "" comedian strips away all of rubell\'s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it\'s a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees . \nand while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate "" austin powers "" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with "" 54 "" \'s overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball . \n'",1

"b""everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' \nin this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . \nthe film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . \ndr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . \nthe bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . \n'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . \nthe spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's \nhumans . \nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs . \nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . \nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . \nif it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . \nthe director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . \nthere are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . \nif the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . \nin fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . \nthere is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . \nthe camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . \nthe peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . \nsorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . \nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . \ntheir reasonable good fun , however . \nmimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . \nlike dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . \nit may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . \nbut looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . \na good opportunity , then , wasted . \na shame . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 \n""",0
"b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\'ll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\'s true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "" \nthat\'s not to say the men don\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \n'",1

"" \n---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series\' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . \na russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . \na rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . \nposing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . \nthe real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . \nethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose\'s . \nreluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . \nethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . \nalthough the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn\'t much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . \nthat problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . \nthe end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . \nunfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah\'s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . \nethan\'s conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . \njohn woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups . \nthe surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . \nthankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah\'s deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed . \nrobert towne\'s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . \nafter that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo\'s previous high-octane films . \nthe final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) . \nas far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . \nanyone looking for hardcore action won\'t be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) . \neven if you weren\'t a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out . \n[pg-13] \n'",1

"b""arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year . \nhowever , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good . \ndonahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth . \nthe film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles . \nalthough events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on . \nalthough an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . \nthe biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . \nmost of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie . \nthe 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students . \nthere are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly . \nif i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp . \nbut no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how . \nthe supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes . \nwith no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not . \ni never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film . \nhowever , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? ' \na lot , and mike giggling like a loony . \nthere's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things . \nthe main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all . \nthe film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing . \nalso , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation . \nthere are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one . \nthe blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver . \ni suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . \napart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull . \nthe spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide . \nalthough a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience . \nit's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com \n ) is better than the film . \n""",0
"b'the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer\'s other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and "" rambo "" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it\'s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here\'s what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan\'s army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can\'t be the evil superdemon he\'s expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn\'s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don\'t have a single scene together before simmons\' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody\'s guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \nso many questions are left unanswered , and i\'m sure they won\'t be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \nwhile last year\'s the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven\'t the faintest idea how to make a movie . \n'",0
"b'the central focus of michael winterbottom\'s "" welcome to sarajevo "" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there . \nit proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( "" platoon "" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible "" the walking dead "" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( "" schindler\'s list "" ) . \nthe two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false . \nthe question is not what went right . \nthe question is what went wrong . \nfor one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that\'s about it . ) . \nthe assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter "" into "" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children\'s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive . \nthe interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . \nstill , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music . \nand it\'s a plus , because he doesn\'t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness . \nhe wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious . \nthe sweet hereafter \nstarring ian holm , sarah polley , bruce greenwood , tom mccamus , gabrielle rose , arsinee khanjian , alberta watson , maury chaykin , caerthan banks . \nproduced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg . \nscript by atom egoyan ( based on the novel by russell banks ) . \ndirected by atom egoyan . \nrunning time : 110 mins . \nrated r . __________________________________________________________ \natom egoyan\'s powerfully meditative "" the sweet hereafter "" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i\'ve seen this year . \nit not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected . \nian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he\'s a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she\'s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town . \nand in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity . \nit\'s one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i\'ve ever seen . \nbut the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future . \nher ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near-revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for "" breaking the waves "" . \nboth women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love . \n "" the sweet hereafter "" though , is atom egoyan\'s movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema . \nafter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994\'s "" exotica "" , "" the sweet hereafter "" makes him something few people in this industry can call themselves : an artist . \nhe interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common . \n'",1
"b'when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . \none of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . \nwoody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy\'s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . \nwoody succeeds in his mission , but doesn\'t make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al\'s toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector\'s item and steals him . \nbuzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . \nmeanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . \nal has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950\'s tv puppet show "" woody\'s round-up "" except for a woody doll . \nnow that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . \nthe gang is happy about the move ; they\'ve been in storage for years waiting for woody . \nif woody doesn\'t go with them , they\'ll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . \ntrying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . \nwhile woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al\'s toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn\'t know he\'s a toy . \nthe new buzz generates the movie\'s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg\'s fortress "" ( i . e . , al\'s apartment building ) . \nthe original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . \nwhile most kids\' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn\'t special , that he was just like everyone else . \nbuzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . \nin other words , it\'s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . \nmost of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we\'re not space rangers and we\'re never going to be . \n "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . \nwoody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . \nthis is another big grown-up theme : everything ends . \nthe theme is introduced early in the movie when woody\'s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . \non the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who\'s dusty , broken , and forgotten . \nthe other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody\'s ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . \nafter he\'s stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . \nof course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it\'s also very funny . \nmost of the laughs come from the toys\' assault on al\'s toy barn and on the apartment building . \nthe brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i\'d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . \nmost of the vocal performances are first-rate . \ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . \nhowever , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast . \nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . \nalthough he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . \nhe doesn\'t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . \nthe animation is even better than in the first . \nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures . \nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . \nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain . \nas you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar\'s \'toy story 2\' "" -- this is pixar\'s coming out party . \nto celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . \nthey made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . \non the downside , "" toy story 2 "" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . \noverall , though , i had a great time and found "" story 2 "" to be a worthy successor to the first "" toy story .

"b'porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years . \nthey and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country .

"" \nso , is it that bad ? \nthe answer is no . \nbut it\'s not very good either . \nthe major problem with "" town and country "" is that it\'s unstructured and random . \nstoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . \nnext scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . \nthen mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples\' divorce lawyer ) . \nellie thinks she\'s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family\'s mississippi manse . \nthe two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they\'d never become a couple to begin with . \nback home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter\'s cheating on her . \nporter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he\'s gay . \nthe four friends , along with every woman porter\'s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . \nalthough the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . \nthe stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who\'s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . \nafter an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . \nporter\'s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . \nonce the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . \nwhile beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . \nmaybe we\'re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn\'t initiate his own sex romps ? \nkeaton\'s ellie has a trusting nature that\'s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . \nhawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives\' club "" while shandling\'s relegated to true second banana status . \nkinski is bland and unmotivated . \nandie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay\'s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . \nheston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . \noscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones .

"b'and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year . \nturns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts . \nit\'s a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . \nfor a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it\'s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . \nfor the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn\'t count ) is no fun at all . \n "" end of days "" is a major stinker . \nthe movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . \nsome catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . \nif he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . \nthe pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . \nin new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . \ntwenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem . \nnow working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . \nan assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . \nrecognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . \nthere are so many problems with this film it\'s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? \ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\'s location by offering him his old life back . \nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\'t up to the task . \nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \nthis one isn\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \nas the prince of darkness , he\'s suave and confident . \nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \nbyrne\'s speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" \'tis not ! "" \nvariety ) are feeble at best . \nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \nkevin pollack plays jericho\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \nrobin tunney isn\'t given much to do except look scared . \nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \nthis being an action blockbuster , it\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\'s utterly ridiculous . \nwhy is the devil coming on new year\'s eve , 1999 ? \nbecause it\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\'t 666 , it turns out . \nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\'ve got 1999 ! \nif you don\'t buy this explanation , you\'re not alone . \nit\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \n . \n . ) , and if that weren\'t bad enough , there\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\'t explained at all . \nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\'s powerless ? \nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \nhow come he can\'t control jericho or christine ? \nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\'s never actually explained . \nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \nit gets so formulaic that it\'s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come . \ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don\'t care about these characters ( due to the script\'s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don\'t make any sense . \nthere\'s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \nit\'s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \nsupposedly we\'re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it\'s often hard to tell why it\'s happening in the first place , not to mention that they\'re edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! "" \n "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it\'s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \nthe devil apparently doesn\'t operate in the more subtle , i\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \nthis doesn\'t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it\'s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \nscenes aren\'t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \nreasons ? \nto hell with reasons ! \nlet\'s just blow stuff up ! \nisn\'t it cool ? \nnope , not by a long shot . \nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \nit\'s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it\'s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \n "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn\'t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody\'s going to buy . \nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \nif it\'s going to be campy , arnold shouldn\'t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn\'t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn\'t be such a sad sack . \nas it stands , "" end of days "" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . \n'",0
"b'you know you\'re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question\'s most normal character . \nsuch is the case with "" the big lebowski , "" joel and ethan coen\'s first venture since their "" fargo "" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . \nthere\'s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because "" lebowski "" is an effort that makes words like "" strange "" and "" unusual "" seem like an understatement . \nthanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . \nthe central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . \none night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that\'s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . \nonce the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long . \nsoon , though , lebowski\'s trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . \nit seems bunny\'s troubles are related to a line of work she\'s kept secret from her husband -- she\'s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . \nthe dude , now on lebowski\'s payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . \nchaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski\'s ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . \n "" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . \nthe movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . \nthe coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . \nwhether we\'re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively . \nthere are those who will dislike this film , but not because it\'s boring . \nthe cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they\'re given . \nbridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn\'t the cleanest guy around , but you\'d still follow him to another movie . \ngoodman merits 1998\'s first oscar consideration , as walter\'s manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" \'s many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . \njohn turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . \nsam elliott\'s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . \nand some will recognize peter stormare -- "" fargo "" \'s silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who\'s really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . \nonly in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . \nthese flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it\'s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . \nwithout a doubt , "" the big lebowski "" is the best film so far this year . \nsure , we\'re only three months in and the competition ( "" deep rising , "" "" desperate measures , "" "" the wedding singer , "" etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it\'s still the gospel truth . \nmaybe during next awards season , "" lebowski "" won\'t be a far cry from "" fargo .

"b'hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong\'s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong\'s rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai\'s boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit\'s not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \nsuspicions escalate , as issac o\'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .

security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother\'s death . \n "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather "" . \nthe relationship between jet li\'s han and aaliyah\'s trish o\'day reminds us of abel ferrera\'s "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die\'s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit\'s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o\'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac\'s son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry\'s best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah\'s bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet\'s u . s . debut ) didn\'t allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet\'s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba\'s "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit\'s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n\'rmd\' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan\'s films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx "" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn\'t let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in \'romeo must die\' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit\'s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we\'ll be left with emotionally hollow product like "" the replacement killer "" and , currently "" romeo

"b'field of dreams almost defies description . \nalthough it\'s about baseball , it\'s not a baseball movie . \nalthough the film is extremely spiritual , it\'s not about religion . \nand although field of dreams is melodramatic , it\'s not a tearjerker . \nto really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . \nin the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , \'60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . \none day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : "" if you build it , he will come .

"b'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\' acclaimed novel \'the invisible man\' . \nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \nthe director is paul verhoven . \nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \nthe problem is to keep us there . \ni can\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \nthe first two faces are completed . \nnow , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human . \ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \nbut that\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \nthough it\'s based on a novel called \'the invisible man\' , the title has been ironically changed to \'hollow man\' that sums up the film very nicely . \nthis is a very silly production . \nlaughable , actually . \napparently verhoven\'s imagination doesn\'t stretch too far . \nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\' locker room undetected . \nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\'t stop there . \nhe becomes a rapist . \nand then , of course , a murderer . \nyou\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \nshue\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \nbeing probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing . \nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \npretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \nhe was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" , "" total recall "" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \nin a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection . \nit\'s not better or worse than verhoven\'s average film . \nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\'ll be screaming "" nooooo ! "" \nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \nand all we can ask is why ? \nthe answer is simple . \nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \nit\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \na void where its imagination should be . \n'",0

"b'janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that\'s made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why "" easier said than done "" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can\'t get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the "" meet cute . "" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o\'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it\'s the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o\'hara on sight . \nthat\'s how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she\'d hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they\'d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven\'t mentioned the movie\'s twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o\'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he\'ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o\'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker\'s utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone\'s still on after he\'s done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n'",0
"b'overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson\'s novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson . \nhe is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . \nhe drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience\'s patience . \ni know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? \nthe original was a great psychological horror film . \nthis new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . \nin fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . \nunless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there\'s nothing in this film that will raise hackles . \ni nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn\'t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . \nit\'s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . \nowen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . \ncatherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . \nliam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what\'s going on as the rest of them do . \nfinally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . \napparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor\'s characters was filmed but removed . \nthat\'s too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . \nthis is jan de bont\'s second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . \nwhen is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? \nrobert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . \none should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . \nif de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . \nwhat our mind fashions on it\'s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . \napparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it\'s original title . \ni certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont\'s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had . \n[pg-13] \n'",0
"b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\'connell . \nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . "" \nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \ndon\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\'s up to you to decide . \nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\'s skin . \nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \nwhen playing "" george "" in disney\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\'s , didn\'t get much personal attention . \nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \nthe mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \ni didn\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \n'",1
"b""lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . \nafter the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' \nopening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . \nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . \nhowever , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) \nthey also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) \nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . \nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . \nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . \nthere's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . \nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . \nthere's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . \nthe script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . \nthere's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . \nthe two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . \nqui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . \nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . \nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) \nanakin is annoying and unlikeable . , \ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . \nit's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . \nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . \nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . \nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . \nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . \nagain , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . \nthe actors don't help the movie much either . \nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . \nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . \nthe casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . \nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . \nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . \nthere's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . \nhe's not even very 'cute . ' \nthe main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . \nthere's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . \nthe cgi takes away much of the human element , however . \nthe battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . \nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit's got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . \ndisappointing is barely the word . \nrating= \n""",0

"b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\'s to live and die in l . a . \nthe money isn\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\'s movie was inspired by real life . \ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\'s directing skills . \nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung "" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \n'",1

"b'the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor . \nas a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin\'s character did it all for money . \nin his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry . \nhe wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door . \nplaying the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie . \nthis con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner . \nmaybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil . \nbowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars . \nmartin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother . \nthe story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain . \nin order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie . \nthe only problem is that kit refuses to be in it . \nbut this won\'t stop the aggressive bowfinger . \nhe is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him . \nhe has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage . \nwill bowfinger be able to make his film ? \nor will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ? \nbowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line . \nthe only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department . \nthis is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this . \nbesides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . \nif you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . \nif you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun . \n'",1
"b'kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue . \nall he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he\'s thinking . \n "" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas\'s finest performances . \nhe stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night . \nthe film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective\'s work in . \nthe film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there . \nthe bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate . \nhowever , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas\'s wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of . \nmany secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film . \nsecrets i would not dream of giving away . \nwith a name like "" detective story "" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of "" nypd blue "" , but it doesn\'t quite work out that way . \nhowever , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time . \nlee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting . \nher scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs . \nthe performances all around are fantastic . \ndouglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he\'s not the center of attention all the time . \nwe get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases . \nwhich brings me back to douglas . \nhe has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him . \nwe can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he\'s really done is gotten back at his criminal father . \nhow he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing . \nkirk douglas is the kind of actor we don\'t seem to see to much of these days : he\'s a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior . \n'",1
"b'there isn\'t much good about this movie . \nnot much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . \nso i\'ll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn\'t direct it or it would be titled "" technicolor city "" . \nin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . \nthe plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . \nthe plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . \njohn murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . \njohn must find out who he is before the "" strangers "" ( a . k . a . \nmind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . \nduring the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . \nany of these points however are completely "" erased "" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . \nas i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . \nthe acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . \nthe special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true "" b-movie "" . \nthe direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . \nlastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn\'t deserve to have the word "" science "" in science-fiction . \nif i haven\'t got my point across , i\'ll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . \nlets hope the next movie by alex "" i wish i was tim burton "" proyas is at least tolerable . \n'",0
"b'the formula is simple . \ntrap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one . \nthese have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) . \nso , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ? \n ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . ) \nperhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas . \ndeep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film . \ntreat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no \nquestions asked . \nthis time , however , they may have gone too far . \ntheir passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films . \nand their cargo . . . let\'s \njust say it has very high explosive potential . \nwhat is the target of these thieves ? \nwhy , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage . \nbut something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something \nancient and deadly . \nby the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed . \nand now the creature senses fresh meat ! \nso , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep . \nand the monster gets to pick them off one by one . \nfortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . \nwhy else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . \nif there\'s a more clarion call for unity , i don\'t know what it might be . \nit\'s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when . \nthere are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end . \nfor the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience\'s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first . \n ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou\'s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . ) \ntreat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation . \nbut while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way . \nthe biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o\'connor\'s whining engine-boy , under finnegan\'s employ . \nhis constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) . \nit\'s just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . \nas far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency . \nthink back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters . \nthey all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it . \npart of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are . \nthe tentacle monster in deep rising doesn\'t have a set of rules . . . \nor if it does , not a very good one . \nit merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . \nthe film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . \nit simply happens . \nthe action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy . \nthe film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . \ndeep rising\'s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron\'s ( but can you really blame them ) . \nunfortunately , deep rising\'s efforts are more on par with speed 2 . \non the plus side , however , the film\'s closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . \nperhaps you\'d be better off waiting for that one . \n'",0

"b""the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . \neven though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . \nwriter/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion . \ninstead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . \nno looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . \nthe most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . \nalas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . \nand , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . \npeeks of sunshine are few and far between . \nno wonder the characters are all so miserable . \nfirst of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . \nthat girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . \nthe two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other . \nclaudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . \nthen charlie re-enters the mix . \nso who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? \nwho cares ? ? \nno looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . \nso what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . \nthey aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline . \nthey should know the ending as well as we do . \nand burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . \nanother frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters . \nblythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance . \nsadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . \nnone of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . \nedward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . \njon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . \nthe worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . \nas portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love . \nburns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job . \nwhen he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) . \ntwo films and three short years later , the luster has faded . \nsome movie makers have only one good film in them . \nwith back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers , burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club . \n""",0

"b""this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . \njoseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . \nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . \nthe beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . \nthe beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . \nthis is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . \njoshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . \nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . \nthe plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . \nhis answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . \nthis search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist . \nnow , that's a smart kid . \nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . \none of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . \nthroughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) \nquestion about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . \nnothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . \nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . \nthe film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) \ntells him his grandfather is all right . \nhis quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . \nmaybe that's for another film down the road . \nthis part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . \nas this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . \nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . \nwell , god bless him , if he can do that . \nthis is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . \nit's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . \nand that family of his , they're too good for words . \nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . \nfor those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . \n""",0

"b' "" snake eyes "" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\'s a great director and one who\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit\'s worse than that . \nit\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , "" snake eyes "" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\'s classic "" rashomon , "" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that\'s not the worst part of it : it\'s that it\'s the one person you didn\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\'t rely on rick\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \nit\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , "" blow out , "" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\'s earlier "" carlito\'s way , "" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\'t so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\'d be given , and perhaps he\'d have to make a choice between who\'s he has to believe . \nnow there\'s a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n'",0

"" he asks . \nbarnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can\'t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . \nthen the situation turns bad . \ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere . \na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . \nlethal sea snakes attack goodman . \na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" . \nthe suspicious scientists turn against each other . \nthis has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man\'s science fiction film . \nhowever even the finest ingredients don\'t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn\'t seem to care about his product . \ndirector barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn\'t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . \nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . \nit\'s much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . \nit doesn\'t get any better when the action scenes begin . \nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . \noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . \nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . \ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . \neven goodman and halperin\'s ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . \nher psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . \nthere\'s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . \nwhen an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what\'s going to happen . \nthe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . \nchapter headings that divide the movie have no function . \nthe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . \nmuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . \nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn\'t . \neven a science fiction film must be internally consistent . \nthere\'s too much here that doesn\'t make sense . \nare the manifestations real ? \nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . \na scene in the sub suggests that it\'s illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it\'s not . \nnot everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . \nwhere the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . \neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . \nthe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . \nafter pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . \nit\'s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . \nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . \nthe weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn\'t have been much left . \nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there\'s nothing special on the screen . \nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . \nstealing from "" alien "" , "" the abyss "" and the disastrous "" event horizon "" , this film has learned nothing from them . \nremarkably levinson and hoffman\'s other currently showing film is "" wag the dog "" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . \nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word . \n'",0
"b""long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . \none of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . \nthis opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . \nhitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month . \nstopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there . \nnovalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . \na wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . \nthen the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . \nthis film is terrible . \nthe directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . \nwe get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . \na disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . \na subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . \nan embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . \ntaking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . \naltogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . \nhowever , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? \nno one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . \n""",0
"b""breakdown is an moderately entertaining , if underwhelming , thriller . \nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor , taking the scenic route to california through redneck country . \nhowever , while in the middle of nowhere , their jeep decides to break down , leaving them stranded . \na friendly truck driver , warren ( walsh ) , offers to give them a lift to town . \nalthough jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) , amy agrees , hops into warren's lorry , and promptly disappears . \njeff wonders where the hell she is , and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life , the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . \nalthough comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise , the latter two are far superior character and script wise . \nkurt russell is o . k as jeff , although he can seemingly only pull of one expression , which is angry . \nthroughout the whole film , he looks angry ( or just pissed off . ) \nquinlan is o . k again , but again she can only pull off one expression , which is looking dorky . \nthroughout the whole film , she looks dorky . \nj . t walsh ( who , sadly , recently passed away ) is fine as warren ( who we soon find out is a kidnapper ) although his actual character is pretty weak , and not really menacing enough . \nthe supporting cast do their best aswell , with rex linn as a doubting sheriff , and the other kidnappers . \nthe story , written by first-timer jonathan mostow ( who also directs ) is o . k , if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid . \nsome of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy . \nthere are some flaws with the plot also , as the characters do the complete opposite to logical ( presumably to keep the story 'exciting' ) and also the fact that the story just isn't strong enough to sustain the audience's attention . \nthe picture moves along very slowly also . \nit almost threatens to drop dead . \nthe picture does pick up towards the end , but by then it's too late . \nmostow directs the action sequences well enough , however . \nthe film doesn't really come to a satisfying conclusion , either . \nthe ending tries to be bleak , but just comes off annoying . \nbreakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director . \ninstead , it just turns out to be merely average . \na missed opportunity . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock \n""",0
"b'we\'re back in blade runner territory with this one , conceptual artist robert longo\'s vision of a william gibson-inspired future where information is the commodity to kill for . \nfront and center is johnny ( keanu reeves ) , a "" cyber-courier "" who smuggles data via a "" wet-wired "" implant . \nhe\'s ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his long-term memory restored , but , first , he has to finish one last , dangerous job . . \nthe pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed . \nhe\'s walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins , ice-t , and dina meyer . \n ( dolph lundgren\'s street preacher is in an acting category all its own . \n : - ) without a believable performance between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere , which is pretty good in places . \nthe vr sequences are way cool , but the physical fx--such as miniatures and mattes--leave a lot to be desired . \nwatch out for those bad blue-screens ! \nwe wouldn\'t mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better . \ntoo bad the debut director isn\'t very strong in this de- partment . \nhis big finale is a sloppy , silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long , which is way past the time that most of our "" wet- wired "" processors have already shut down . \nbottom line : yatf ( yet another tortured future ) . \nskip it . \n'",0
"b'robert altman\'s cookie\'s fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \nwe also fleetingly see emma\'s lover jason ( chris o\'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \nshe exclaims "" here i come ! "" \nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . \nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . \nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . \nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . \nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn\'t do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . \nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . \nso begins cookie\'s fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo , "" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers\' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . \nrobert altman\'s slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . \nindeed , most of the characters in cookie\'s fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . \nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific "" aunt alexandria "" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . \nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) \nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . \ncookie\'s fortune is such a movie . \ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . \ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . \ni even liked the trite "" in the south everybody is related to everybody "" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . \ni\'m not sure why cookie\'s fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . \nperhaps it\'s that good ol\' southern charm . \n'",1
"b'synopsis : a humorless police officer\'s life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist . \nunfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . \nmeanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie . \ncomments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz\'s bestselling novel watchers . \ntechnically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles . \n ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) \nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . \nthis really isn\'t a good movie . \nhave you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? \nwell , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he\'s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . \nthey\'re awful . \nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio . \nscott baio ! \nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up ? \nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \n "" maybe it won\'t be * that * bad "" he may say to himself . \n "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! "" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \nit\'s definately not a koontz book if there isn\'t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people\'s eyeballs . \nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it\'s arguably the most popular of koontz\'s books . \nthe idea behind koontz\'s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target\'s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \nsilly but kind of neat too . \ni\'m sorry . \ni don\'t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \ni suppose i just don\'t want to talk about the movie itself . \nthis turkey is really cheesy . \nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it\'s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \nthe cheese factor is only increased when he\'s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she\'s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \nand the creature ! \nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it\'s okay . \nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat\'s another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film\'s campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film\'s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it\'s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \nfinally , i couldn\'t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as "" bot fodder "" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , "" mystery science theater 3000 . "" \nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \nit also has violence , obviously . \ni wouldn\'t recommend it for the little kids , but i\'m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz\'s book . \ntrust me , it\'ll be time much , much better spent . \n'",0
"b""did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? \nthat is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . \nshe is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . \nthe dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . \njeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . \nhe is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . \nhis remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . \nthe background to the case is such . \nduring christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . \nthe same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . \nwhen examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . \nclaus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . \nhe immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . \nron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . \nwe follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . \ndershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . \nnevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . \ntogether with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . \nsilver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . \nschroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . \nthere are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . \nyet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . \nthe flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . \nthe movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . \nthe film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . \nthe supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . \nyet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . \nas von bulow , he is brutally evil . \nanti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . \nirons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . \nhe is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . \nhowever , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . \nthere is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . \nhowever , legally , did he do the murder ? \nschroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . \nwith all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . \nschroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . \nfor all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . \nwe don't know what happened . \nthat sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . \nin the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . \nirons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good . \n""",1

america\'s video shelves . \nhaving made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . \nhis latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . \nand by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true . \njackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . \nthe royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . \nunwilling to follow her father\'s wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . \nbut this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess\' kidnapping and ransom . \nunable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city\'s bravest guards ( played by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . \nchon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . \non a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o\'bannon ( owen wilson ) . \nhe is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . \nwith his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang\'s uncle . \nchon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . \nas the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . \nburied up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . \nchon demands to know where carson city is . \nroy directs him , and chon leaves . \nbut not before sticking two chopsticks into roy\'s mouth and telling him to dig himself . \nchon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . \n "" shanghai noon "" is just good fun . \nthe chemistry between the cast is remarkable . \nthe performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . \njackie\'s performance is as good as anything he\'s done before . \nhe\'s not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . \nbut jackie\'s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . \nowen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o\'bannon . \nhis innocence is refreshing and fun . \na bad guy that\'s not really bad . \nhis scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis . \nlucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant . \nthe character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . \nthe rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . \nnothing here is realistic , mind you . \n "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . \nand the performances match that style with ease . \nthe cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . \nusing calgary , alberta as the prime location . \nmr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . \nnothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . \nand as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . \nhomage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . \nit is a comforting experience . \nat a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . \nhere is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . \nthis is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o\'brian or john wayne . \ndirector tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood\'s past . \nin this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . \nnothing here really stands out , or takes one\'s attention away from the story or action . \nand that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . \nand what of the action and stunts . \nwell , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie\'s hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . \nhis timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . \njackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . \nfinally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and

"b'maybe this mission should have been scrubbed \nmission to mars \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nthere\'s a world of difference between artists and technicians . \nthe artist has a vision to create something new . \nhe may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it\'s something you\'ve never seen before . \na good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it\'s going to be just a xerox . \nobviously successful films need both skills . \nbrian de palma is a masterful technician . \nhe\'s spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . \nhe usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote . \naside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead . \nin de palma\'s latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . \nto tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 "" . \ni enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters "" . \nnasa has set its sights for mars . \nwhen the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet . \nthey don\'t do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . \nand it\'s all so boring . \nthere are so many scenes that just don\'t work , it\'s difficult to begin . \nwhen the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching . \nerror . \nthe most interesting character ( and that\'s not saying much ) is killed off . \nerror . \nthe alien is laughable . \nerror . \nthe rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . \nerror . \nthere\'s some nice eyecandy . \nthe face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool . \na three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world . \nmaneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic . \nbut there\'s so much more that feels as if we\'ve been there before . \nfrom "" 2001 "" , there\'s the rotating space station , the blinding white room . \n>from "" close encounters "" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . \nthe list goes on . \nthe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . \neven gary sinise and tim robbins can\'t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . \nno one seems to care about anything that happens . \nyou won\'t either . \nthe absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day . \nthey should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film . \n'",0
"b""i love movies . \ni really do . \nevery time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . \neven lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . \nthen there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . \ndisney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . \nchristopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . \nalong with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' \n'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . \nmany bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . \nfilled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . \nchristopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . \njeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . \nhis performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . \ndarryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . \nhurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' \nway to go liz ! \nfor the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' \nbefore finally giving up and switching off . \nanother major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' \nunfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . ' \ninstead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . \nalthough meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud . \na real dud . \ncitizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . \neven the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . \nit's a nice special effect , though . \nanother problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . \nor rather , the lack of them . \nmy favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . \nnow , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . \nbut here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . ' \nit's insulting . \nthere's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . \neither that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . \nyes , men at work . \nyowza ! \nthe fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . \nthere are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . \nthankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet . \n""",0
"b'warning : may contain slight mild spoilers . \nrated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language . \nstarring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne . \nrunning time : 132 minutes \nwe go into a movie theater , boom ! \nthe lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we\'ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on . \nwe sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is . \nwhy shouldn\'t i have know what i was getting myself into . \nagain like this past summers hit "" stigmata "" , "" end of days "" may be worse . \nit\'s not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some "" rosemary\'s baby "" , along with "" the devil\'s advocate "" a little "" exorcist "" and some "" stigmata "" here and there . \nwhala you have "" end of days "" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . \nsadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . \nthe plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . \njericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . \nhe has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he\'s trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . \nhe seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that\'s satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . \nthat\'s pretty much it on plot . \nit does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . \nas for arnie ? \ngood role , ok performance . \ni think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . \nthe thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . \nin the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . \ngabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in "" stigmata "" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character . \ntwo years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun "" the devil\'s advocate "" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . \nrobin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan\'s main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . \nof course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn\'t nothing new . \nthe direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in "" stigmata "" . \nhere we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don\'t work in this movie . \nthe script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . \nonly a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don\'t work as well . \nthe sad thing is that "" end of days "" had so many things going for it . \nthe plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing . \nat times it seems like "" armageddon "" and started to get old and tiresome . \nhollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i\'ve always said before needs new ones . \neven with its 100m budget "" end of days "" is less than pleasing . \nin fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget . \nmaybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original . \nwe need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office . \nwe need to get more films like "" the blair witch project "" that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch . \noverblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm \nyup those pretty much describe "" end of days "" . \n'",0
"b'>from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . \nat reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . \ncourtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . \neveryone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . \ncourtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . \nit is liz\'s seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . \njust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . \nand also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don\'t agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . \nand finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . \nthis time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney\'s group , as well as the entire school . \n>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . \nnot only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . \njudy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . \nalso on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . \non the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn\'t match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996\'s scream . \nmcgowan\'s role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . \nshe is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . \nfaring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . \nwhen the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . \ngayheart isn\'t given as much to do here as she was in 1998\'s urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . \njawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . \nwe get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don\'t have anything to do with the actual film . \nthe beginning and ending are strong , it\'s just the middle that needs a lot of help . \nduring the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . \nnothing to grab the viewer\'s interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . \njawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . \nthe few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . \nall in all , a horrible disappointment . \nthe bottom line : the tagline reads , "" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside .

"b'well i guess it\'s that time of the year again . \nthe one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions . \nit\'s also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases . \nin america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year . \nand maybe it\'s the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like "" consider this a divorce , "" "" hasta la vista , baby , "" and "" you\'re the disease . \ni\'m the cure "" actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs . \nthis is not entirely a bad thing , of course . \nwhat am i talking about ? \ni\'m talking about the summer "" blockbusters , "" the "" action thrillers , "" the "" this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone\'s-going-to-go "" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects . \nin the rash of "" my , what big guns you have , but wait ! \nmine are bigger "" movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of "" save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats "" offerings . \ni\'m talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i\'m talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser . \nhere in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of "" my explosion is more real-looking than yours "" movies , but nothing else . \nmission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us . \nthe same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation . \nthat\'s saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the \'60s/\'70s . \nin eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger . \nhe does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities . \nhis new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he\'s ever relocated , is "" an actual , real life honest person . "" \nbecause she\'s so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers . \nlee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair . \nof course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate . \nin protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn\'t the one killing the programme\'s witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn\'t accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have . \nit\'s around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie\'s mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk . \ni guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about . \nit\'s an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls . \nit has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim\'s heart even from great distances . \ndespite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i\'m certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun . \ninstead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : "" i\'ll be back . "" \nlike everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily . \nalthough there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas . \nreview\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'",0
"b'there\'s a good , and timely , story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first , a new movie about the abuses of our prison system . \nwith a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies--a point of view . \nbut director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important . \nthere\'s not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling . \nand everything suffers . \nchristian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate , respectively . \nafter spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape , bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial . \nhis young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to "" put alcatraz on trial "" for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) . \nthe result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students . \nthere\'s very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon\'s earnest overacting and the appropriate story . \nthere\'s a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you\'re in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge , the center of reason and moderation . \nslater has never been convincing and certainly isn\'t here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances . \nbut the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story . \nthere are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters , let alone with them . \nhow frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions . \nif there\'s anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world , it is our ability to tell a good story . \nhave we forgotten ? \n'",0

"" \nindeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . \nand for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger\'s comeback , will not be very satisfied . \nwe\'ve not seen him in a while . \nthat\'s because he didn\'t have a worthy opponent . \nhe has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . \nhe has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop . \nso , after all those fights , what\'s left for arnold schwarzenegger ? \nhow about satan ? \nin my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron\'s "" terminator "" . \nand that is schwartzenegger\'s strength -- muscles and no emotions . \nhere he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . \nthis is called "" an adult turn "" if successful and "" a flop "" if unsuccessful . \nmake a wild guess ! \nhis character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . \nthis requires at least some acting skills . \nregrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . \nthe rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . \nthe movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . \nbut the movie doesn\'t serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . \nthe only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . \nthe action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . \nso i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . \nunless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . \nas for schwarzenegger , he\'ll be back . \n'",0
"b'in the continuation of warner brother\'s franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . \nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . \navika goldsman\'s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . \nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as "" the client "" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . \nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . \nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone\'s batgirl , who just happens to be alfred\'s niece . \nthe story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . \nwhile working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . \nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . \nnow the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . \nif mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . \nthis is indeed a cold hearted man . \nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . \nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . \nshe joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . \nthe characters have no logic . \nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . \nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . \ngeorge clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . \nto say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . \nhis best performances are still on "" e . r .

"b'synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . \nin a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . \nunder sonny\'s supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he "" wipes his ass , "" throw tantrums , and scream for his "" god damned "" treats . \nself centered , julian breaks a school classmate\'s arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong . \nmeanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform . \nnot surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny\'s incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle . \nopinion : it\'s a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . \nthat\'s the essence of big daddy . \nbut there\'s a bigger issue involved : marketing . \nmovies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . \non tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies . \nthen when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment . \nfolks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . \nto many american mothers there\'s probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman\'s "" ice cold tits .

"b'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn\'t keep the mystery for long , and once the big \'secret\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn\'t have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it\'s no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there\'s no-one to root for . \nwe\'re supposed to be on cage\'s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise\'s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film\'s use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don\'t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn\'t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere\'s a good story buried in snake eyes , it\'s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy \'number cruncher\' wrapped up in the case , there\'s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you\'re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . \na david wilcock review ? 1998 \n "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes \n'",0

"b'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\'s so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\'t stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\'re not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\'t have driven the rest of it . \n'",0
"b""let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . \nso i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . \ni watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . \nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \nin other words , the sound sucked . \nas someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . \ni'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . \nthere , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . \nwhich sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . \nmy guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . \nit is nothing short of stunning visually . \nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . \nthe computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . \nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . \nthat is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . \nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \n""",1
"b""the happy bastard's quick movie review \nthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . \nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . \nsadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . \nsince the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . \nthe story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . \nhis popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . \nthen , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . \nthese two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . \nforward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . \nhowever , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . \nwith the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . \nof course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . \nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . \nfinally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . \nthe main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . \nin fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . \nbut that's just it- scenes . \nthere's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . \ni mean , was this really necessary ? \ncouldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? \ni mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? \nparticularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? \nthat really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . \nthe acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . \nstill , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? \nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . \n""",0

"" \nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \nthey and the rest of the town\'s children come into harm\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \neach little aspect has its own fascination . \nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\'s numerous faults . \nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \nwell , single parent billy\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \n ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \n "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back . \nmitchell\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \nmychael danna\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \n'",1

"b' "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . "" \nstarring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong \neight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love . \nneither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough . \nand along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films . \nslim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york . \nwhen the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver . \nhe does not seem particularly out of place . \nin fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home . \nhe brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they\'re american ) --the tokens of his success . \nhe also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) . \nhe loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents\' village . \nwhen he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father . \nall of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening\'s end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl . \nbut eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable . \ndirector mabel cheung ( an autumn\'s tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home . \nslim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language . \nseeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home . \nthe condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic . \non his way to his parent\'s village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man . \nslim and odds-and-ends fall for each other . \nthat\'s predictable . \nthe manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not . \nthe emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma . \nit\'s typical , for instance , that the fianc ?

"b""the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . \nalas , it refers to our heroes ! \nas it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . \nafter all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . \nbut the human race doesn't have much to worry about . \nafter all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . \nshe's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . \nthey're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . \nlucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . \nthe evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . \nsoon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . \nfinally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! \nit's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! \nvirus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . \nwhen considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . \nit's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . \ni liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . \nvirus takes itself seriously . \nand , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . \nbut what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . \nokay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . \nthey need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . \non the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . \nafter that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . \nthe leader , of course , is a big creature . \nevery film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . \nvirus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening . \nit's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . \non one level , virus is almost passable fun . \nit's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) . \nthere's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . \nthe bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . \nit rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . \nin that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes . \n""",0
"b'a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \nit\'s jeroen krabb ? \'s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can\'t forget their bitter past . \nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can\'t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don\'t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn\'t talk . \nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn\'t gone away there\'s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman\'s book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \nit starts off telling chaja\'s story of how she\'s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can\'t be forgotten . \nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja\'s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \ntopol\'s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can\'t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja\'s loving care he\'s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \'quack , quack\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy\'s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \ni felt i didn\'t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \nunless i was mistaken and the film\'s real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \n'",0

"b'susan granger\'s review of "" ghosts of mars "" ( sony pictures entertainment ) \nhorror auteur john carpenter ( "" halloween , "" "" vampires "" ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that\'s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . \nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year\'s "" pitch black , "" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . \nin the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . \ngrier , pill-poppin\' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch "" desolation "" williams - that\'s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . \nbut when they\'re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . \nit seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as "" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , "" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . \ncarpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the "" night of the living dead "" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . \nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" ghosts of mars "" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . \nperhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : "" mission to mars "" and "" red planet .

"b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit\'s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor\'s first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . \nany hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film\'s latter half . \nthe film\'s central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . \nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . \nnick casually asks for terry\'s wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . \nof course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . \nlearning of nick\'s condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry\'s compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick\'s lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry\'s death wish by killing him . \nthis is a promising premise , and mr . taylor\'s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . \nthis is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . \nhowever , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . \nunfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film\'s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . \nfar from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . \nmr . taylor\'s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as "" you should have asked something more interesting , like \'do you enjoy the pain ? \' \n- see , that\'s provocative , leaves room for further questions . "" ) \nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick\'s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . \nthis occurs particularly often during the film\'s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i\'m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it\'s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick\'s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . \nthe entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . \namong the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang\'s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . \nmr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . \nthe charge of dream with the fishes\'s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . \nfor dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . \n'",0
"b'a follow-up to disney\'s live-action "" 101 dalmatians "" that\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith "" 102 dalmatians , "" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996\'s "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\'s laborious film . \nwhat makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\'t even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\'s split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\'s in "" men of honor .

delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet \'n southern new girl in town . \nalthough the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e . \ncasey is delilah\'s photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don\'t have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren\'t really even sure if they can trust one another . \n "" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90\'s . \nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . \nthe plotline of "" the faculty , "" involving aliens taking over other people\'s bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" to "" the puppet masters , "" to "" invaders from mars , "" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . \nsurely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren\'t . \nthe epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . \nthe performances in "" the faculty "" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . \none exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . \nas members of the faculty , robert patrick ( "" t2 : judgement day "" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the "" queen "" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \nalthough not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , "" the faculty "" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren\'t human . \nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan\'s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \n'",1

"b""have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ? \nwell , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation . \nbut after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond . \noddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc . \nin the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down . \nusing an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office . \nthe law firm's employees get a good chuckle . \nthe audience gets a good chuckle . \nthe eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) . \nthere is something compelling about this mysterious woman . \ndespite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her . \nafter the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago . \nafter each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state . \nthe eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions . \nbut he does not alert the authorities . \nhe somehow empathizes with her sense of loss . \nthe eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past . \nhis daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life . \nhis tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation . \nshe becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman . \nhe now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation . \nit doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders . \nand it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens . \nhe follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble . \nwhen a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking . \nwhen the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape . \nall the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight . \npeculiar . \nhow bad is this movie ? \ni refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test . \njust take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes . \nfor this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . ' \nno doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . \nthe major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . \nif it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . \nif it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . \ncompletely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . \ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . \nbeyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . \n""",0

"b""do the folks at disney have no common decency ? \nthey have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick . \nwasn't mr . magoo enough , people ? \nobviously not . \ninspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment . \nyounger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . \nthe movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . \nall the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite . \nas a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain . \nin the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer . \nwe never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat . \nas a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years . \nwith the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . \nrupert everett ? ! \nonly now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) . \nhe sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version . \nit helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far . \nwhen all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . \nhe does still have his cat , though . \nin the title role , matthew broderick looks lost . \nthe actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers . \nbroderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people . \nhe has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics . \nbut one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world . \njohn courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames . \nin a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys . \nand so is born inspector gadget . \nas bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . \nbroderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city . \nand there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! ' \nalas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . \nthere are so many tired plot additions . \ngadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . \nhughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . \nboth are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . \nwell , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . \nand don't even get me started about the villains . \ni didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . \nthe characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . \npenny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . \nthe special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . \nthe problem here lies solely in the script . \nperhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . \nhere is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway . \n""",0

"" \nlike jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he\'s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . \nzach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . \nconsequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . \nin fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife\'s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . \nto add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . \nfor instance , vincent gardenia\'s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . \nof all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach\'s wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role . \nbecause we don\'t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film\'s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . \nthe comedy in skin deep doesn\'t fare much better . \nmost of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . \nabout every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of "" dueling "" condoms . \noverall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . \nmy final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . \nzach\'s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . \nzach\'s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . \nif he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . \nif he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . \nif his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he\'ll clean up his act . \nthe tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter . \nperhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep . \n'",0
"b'i\'ll be the first to admit it . \nwhen you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . \nyes , it\'s a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \ncertainly , the experience wasn\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\'ll \ngonna tell it the way i remember it . "" \nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \nok . . . maybe \nthat\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini\'s records in the opening scenes of the film . \nand that\'s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn\'s motorboat , but i digress . \nanyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he\'s a really swell guy . \nand then the plot moves on . \nenter miss havisham . . . or \nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \nperhaps it\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\'s nothing . \nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\'s character , and couldn\'t care less about the two characters . \nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \nthere\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \nwithout a strong estella , finn\'s obsession seems baseless . \nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \nfinn\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \nwhat\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \nalthough it\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \nfinn\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\'s romeo+juliet ) . \nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . \nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . \nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you\'d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film . \n'",0
"b' "" marie couldn\'t talk , "" paulie , the parrot star of his own movie , tells us about the daughter in his original family . \n "" dad couldn\'t listen . \nand mom couldn\'t cope , so they got rid of me . "" \npaulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms . \nas the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up . \nbenny , on the other hand , is a character you\'ve seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role . \nroberts\'s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig\'s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems . \nwhen a kids\' movie wants to mosey along , watch out . \nif the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium . \nso it is with paulie . \nwhen they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars . \ntoo often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again . \ntony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study . \nalthough misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i\'m russian . \ni like long stories . "" ) , \nhis somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy . \nbesides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg . \nnaturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart . \nthe bad news is that her part is confined to the first half . \nthe best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills . \nwhen marie\'s family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn\'t wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring . \ntricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball . \ntheir rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation . \nit\'s good quality sitcom material but performed by animals . \nwhen one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes . \n "" i\'m a bird , "" he explains with his frequently subtle humor . \n "" i have a small brain , and it\'s about to explode . "" \nthe movie contains rich doses of john debney\'s dreamy music . \nwith heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film\'s heart-warming themes . \nand when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing . \n "" it\'s a long story , "" says paulie . \n "" it\'s the only kind he knows , "" reflects misha . \nand the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids\' movie , still feels too long . \nthe best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between . \npaulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless . \npaulie runs 1 : 32 . \nit is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages . \nmy son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn\'t enough action . \nhe thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good . \nhis friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was "" awesome , excellent , "" and gave it * * * * . \nhe thought paulie was good , but he didn\'t believe the way marie\'s speech impediment was acted . \n'",0
"b""usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock . \nothers will mention meg ryan . \nbut for me , it's not even close . \njaneane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now . \nand it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull . \ngarofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls . \nin an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory's that never moved to america . \nunfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town's annual matchmaking festival . \nthings get off to a rocky start for marcy though . \nshe has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub . \nhis name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed . \nthe movie runs into a few roadblocks . \nfor instance , the story is very thin . \nnone of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . \nsome of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie . \ni think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile . \nthe strange thing is that it works . \ngarofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one . \n""",1
"b'the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard\'s materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute . \nindeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products . \nincluding this year\'s upcoming a midsummer night\'s dream , shakespeare\'s material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 . \nbut for a change of pace , mrs . \nbrown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love . \nmarc norman and tom stoppard\'s story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . \n ( will shakespeare of the 1590\'s would\'ve been married to anne hathaway , and he would\'ve had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- "" romeo and ethel , the pirate\'s daughter "" -- just doesn\'t quite seem right . \nwith the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , "" romeo and juliet . "" \nthe love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect . \nfiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy . \nthe supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will\'s worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman . \neven ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance . \nthe story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the "" let\'s make a movie "" -genre . \nthe dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience\'s lowest common denominator . \nthere\'s something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material . \nalthough certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998\'s pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . \ncertainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year\'s-open releases is just around the corner . \n'",1
"b'from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . \nhc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we\'re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who\'s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . \nnice to see you , jim . \nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \none entry was definitely enough , and i\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \nit\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \ni should also mention that this movie likely won\'t play all that well in cleveland . \nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \nactually , most of the action involves the twins\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \nleading off this inning is john warren . \nhe steps into the batter\'s box and takes kent\'s pitch low for ball one . \nwh : so , the story\'s strictly minor league , right ? \nwhat\'s it about ? \njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show . "" \nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\' overachieving group against huff\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \nwh : can we guess who wins ? \njb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you\'ve already seen the box score . \non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \nthey\'re not just boring ; they\'re lackluster . \nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they\'ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \n1 and 1 . \nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \njb : not one , from start to finish . \ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \nthe two sequels haven\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \neven bob uecker\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \nhc : here\'s the 1-1 pitch . \nlooooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! \nthe count goes to 1 and 2 . \nwh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? \njb : yes . \nthere aren\'t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \nbut i\'d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \nwh : it\'s nice to see old friends one more time , isn\'t it ? \nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \nthere aren\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \nthey have no depth . \nnotable absences include tom berenger\'s veteran and charlie sheen\'s "" wild thing . "" \nwe don\'t really miss them , though . \nhc : breaking ball , low and outside . \n2 and 2 . \nwh : so you\'re saying that we should give this one a miss ? \njb : that\'s right . \nto use baseball terminology , it\'s a three-pitch strikeout . \nif you\'re looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . \nactually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . \neven the minor league seasons are already underway . \ndon\'t bother with major league : back to the minors . \nit\'s a wretched time- waster . \nwh : thanks for the advice . \njb : you\'re welcome . \nhc : and here\'s the 2-2 pitch . \nfouled back , right into this booth . \nhey , jim , heads up ! \noops . \nsomebody better get him some ice for that . \nhe may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . \nodd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . \nanyway , back to the action on the field ? \n'",0
"b""well there goes another one . \nsadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . \nthis one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . \nfrom the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . \nwith bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . \nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . \nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . \nhere is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . \njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . \nhe really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . \nso he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . \nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . \nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as \nlong as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . \nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . \nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . \neven the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . \nthe plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . \nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . \neven though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . \nrene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . \nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . \nbrooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . \none really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . \nit's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . \n'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . \ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . \nchris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . \nhe seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . \nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . \nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . \nmaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . \nits based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . \neven though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . \nbesides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . \nit has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . \ni did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . \nthe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . \nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . \nbeing one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . \n""",0
"b'devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven\'s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein\'s novel than it is a literary satire . \nthe author\'s jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . \nand i suppose that\'s exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . \nheinlein\'s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . \noutlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it\'s basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . \nsometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . \namong those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . \nwhile carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from "" beverly hills 90210 . "" \nso if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? \nfor one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . \nthe very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . \nif starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . \nit\'s a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it\'s a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it\'s worth . \nthe no-name cast also plays into verhoeven\'s treatment of heinlein\'s most controversial conceit . \nin this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . \nverhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era "" why we fight "" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . \nthese characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . \nit\'s not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . \nin fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . \nverhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he\'s making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . \nif that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it\'s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . \nthere may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody\'s business . \nverhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . \nit is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn\'t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . \ni wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn\'t work out that way . \nthat would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . \n'",1
"b'i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . \nit\'s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . \ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . \nin a word , it\'s the same thing that\'s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . \nmore to the point , it\'s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you\'re telling a story about a relationship . \nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we\'re expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they\'re attractive and pleasant . \nin this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o\'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . \nit\'s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . \nconvinced despite his reservations that it\'s time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . \nanne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . \njimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . \nthere are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy\'s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . \nit\'s a wacky , brewster\'s millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film\'s better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . \nat least that would be the case if jimmy weren\'t already a world-class altruist . \nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn\'t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . \nfrom the outset , jimmy\'s motivation isn\'t cash ; it\'s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . \nit\'s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor\'s plot development . \nby any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . \nand that\'s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . \nthere\'s never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there\'s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . \nthe blandly nice o\'donnell couldn\'t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don\'t even let him ; zellweger\'s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . \nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . \nthe parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they\'re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . \ni\'ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov\'s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . \nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . \nyou\'re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that\'s not the real problem . \nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it\'s leading up to . \nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there\'s no spark , no energy , no humanity . \nit\'s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer\'s digestions . \nwe\'ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don\'t even have a pulse . \nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins . \n'",0
"b""a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain's mountainous coastline . \nhoward pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him , elizabeth ( mimi rogers ) . \nafter a surprise birthday party for him , where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party , he confides to his best friend that he can't stand it anymore , and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon . \njeff is going through a severe mid-life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . \nhe incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . \nhe stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . \nthings change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . \nhe nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . \nby accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . \nwhen other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . \nrealizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . \nbut elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . \nas a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . \nwhile with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . \nhis boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . \nbut soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . \nthere they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . \nthe police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . \nin jail , things look bad for him . \nno one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . \nhis boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . \nout on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . \nthrough a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . \nonce there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . \nthe film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . \nhe is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . \nit was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . \na very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . \nthe film just didn't take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . \nit instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw . \n""",0
"b'robert redford\'s a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . \nit is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . \nuntil 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . \nthe acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . \na friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . "" \nall i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . \nit is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . \nbut certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . \nupon my first viewing i left bawling . \nit is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can\'t help but be effected . \nthe opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . \nmartin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . \nthat is what a river runs through it does . \nit exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . \nboth times i\'ve seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . \nbut the dream is lovely . \n'",1

"b'don\'t get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson\'s naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood . \nhis 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997\'s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that\'s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings . \nbut his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself . \njovovich , besson\'s own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they\'ve since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) . \nand besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one . \nleading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan\'s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side . \nbesson\'s big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject . \nyes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson\'s hallucinatory dream sequences . \nthe whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal . \nthat\'s kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness . \nthat darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she\'s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she\'s overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who\'s about to take a fall . \nas the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance . \ntrouble is , he\'s chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it\'s impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on . \nthis glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer\'s the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan\'s trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema . \ncompared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history . \n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa , 1999 \ntheatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 -------------------------------------------------------------- \n'",0
"b""the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent . \nin other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts . \n54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered . \nthe difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view . \nchristopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark . \nhe keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists . \nthe movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot . \nhe is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur . \nhe's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs . \nmyers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling . \nat one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash . \nthe story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple . \nshades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever . \neventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land . \nhis looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous . \nshane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater . \nbut both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal . \nthe chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent . \n54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie . \nit's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance . \nit's sort of like the musical era it covers . \n""",0

"b'forget get carter . \ninstead . . . \nget me a cup of coffee . \nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? \ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980\'s -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don\'t mean new york city . \nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80\'s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \nget carter is a simple story . \nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \nwhen frank\'s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter\'s way "" . \nhe talks tough with his brother\'s wife , lends a helping had to his brother\'s daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \nwhat a minute ! \nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \n'",0
"b""david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me . \nit also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep . \nlost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect . \ndavid spade is not the problem with lost and found . \nhe plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities . \nthe story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack . \ndylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog . \nand so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over . \nthere are three good things about lost and found . \nthe first is spade . \nthe second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie . \nlastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary . \nunfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute . \nthis kind of physical humor is dead . \npollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel . \nthis is where i start to get fuzzy . \nalso in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila . \ngiven the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow . \nand , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ? \npredictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated . \ndavid spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing . \nthere are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny . \npatrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money . \njon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles . \ndespite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work . \nif you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present . \n""",0
"b' "" there will be another , "" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994\'s the crow , anyway . \nthe idea of spinning artist james o\'barr\'s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \nof course , it doesn\'t . \nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee\'s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \nit\'s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist\'s delight -- but it\'s also horrifying and fascinating . \ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \nthere\'s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won\'t be much of a success . \nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \n ( i\'ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \nperez might have some screen presence if he\'s given something to do with himself , but here he\'s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \nat first , he\'s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \nhe\'s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \ntattooed with angels\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \nlike all good things here , he\'s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \nin the meantime , we\'re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah\'s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren\'t distinctly secondhand . \neven the soundtrack is tired . \nmore than anything i\'ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it\'s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn\'t that bad per se . \nhe\'s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \nhis major stylistic failing is that he can\'t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn\'t , the performers who couldn\'t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \nwho bought david s . goyer\'s anemic script , anyway ? \nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \n'",0
"b""capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . \nthe gags are sporadically funny . \nit is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . \nthe plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . \nthe little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . \nsadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . \nthis feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . \n ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) \n , low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \na film needs a plot . \nit needs characters for empathy value . \nit needs a story and an emotional center . \nif a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are . \nkevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy . \nwith dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp . \npeter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled . \nbut getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it . \nhis remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience . \njay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes . \nhow funny the jokes are will be a subjective call . \nfor me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . \nthere was not enough cleverness or variety . \nit is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . \npenis jokes work only so many times . \nshowing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . \nthey were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico . \njay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners . \nas the series wore on they had larger and larger parts . \nin jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads . \njay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks . \nthis leaves them at loose ends . \nthey are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie . \nthey decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash . \nso it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way . \nthe film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood \nthe problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny . \nsilent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his . \nthis makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have . \njay has to be the comic . \nhe could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive . \nthe problem is that he is not sufficiently funny . \nhe is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair . \nso jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team . \ntheir starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before . \nlike dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . \ncertainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . \nthey are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat . \nit is dogma without any of the humorous theological content . \nthe film does not offer much to an adult audience . \ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n""",0
"b""fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . \nthe film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . \nsome shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . \nand what's more , this beast is heading for new york . \ngulp ! \nalthough godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . \nthe main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies . \nbroderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image . \nwhile emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . \nalso , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . \nshe's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap . \nit's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . \nshame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . \nhank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . \nalso making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . \no . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . \nbut what about the script ? \nwell , that's not up to par either . \nemmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . \nthe dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , \nbroderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) \nalso , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . \nthe jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . \n ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! \nha ha ha ha ! . ) \nthe plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e . \nvelicorapters ) running around new york . \nright , so the script and acting suck . \nbut what about the special effects ? \nthankfully , they're are quite good . \ngodzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . \nthe destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . \nbut although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . \nthe movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending . \nand of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . \nlet's just hope one never arrives . \n""",0
"b'1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept "" . \nin summer 1994 , that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller "" . \nin few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . \nthe movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . \nhe comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . \nfew people except gaerity know the dove\'s violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . \ngaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove\'s colleagues , friends and relatives . \ndove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . \nwhile speed doesn\'t even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . \nand that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . \nbadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . \nscreenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . \nthe plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . \nthe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . \nthose questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . \nbecause of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . \nthe most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . \nhis acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . \nthis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . \nthe film have few bright points , though . \nsome of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . \nand forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove\'s colleague . \nbut , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor . \n'",0
"b'starship troopers is a bad movie . \ni mean , a really , really , bad movie . \nnot only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . \nlooking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . \nthat being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who\'s logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . \nthe film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . \nas the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another\'s hand . \neventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . \nas our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . \n "" what ?

"b'i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . \nmind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . \ni know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream\'s . \nas a result , it\'s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it\'s about thirty times smarter than it is . \nbased on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . \nthe appropriate mood being set ( this is angst-horror for the 90\'s ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town . \nfrom there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male "" hero , "" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five\'s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on . \nafter getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night . \nhis face is mangled so they can\'t tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world . \ncut to one year later . \nthe lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad . \nmain brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college . \nblond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town . \nbrunette male is a fisherman , living off the land . \nblond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team . \nthen , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them . \nit all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie . \nall the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation . \nnot that the movie was without pleasure . \ncount the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun . \nmostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye-catching pair look . \n'",0
"b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\'s steven spielberg drama "" schindler\'s list "" and directed 1993\'s intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \nwhat doesn\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\'s drinking water . \nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \nwatching the film , i couldn\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\'s far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \nnot only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \nin "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \nyou\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what "" a civil action "" does . \nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \naside from one flashback to when a man\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \ni could say the performances were good , but who\'s fooling who ? \nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\'s about all he does . \nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\'s final scene , as a judge ? \nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , "" a civil action "" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \n'",0
"b'silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at "" the last stop cafe and motel "" due to heavy snowfall . \none of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery . \nsomeone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer , but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ? \nadam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film . \nhe doesn\'t play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny . \nhis performance is stuck somewhere in the middle , and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other . \nrose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always , and jurgen prochnow . . . \nwhat on earth is he doing in this ? \nbest performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type . \nthe last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment . \nas usual with sterling , they\'ve filled out this dvd with extra features . \nthe disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound , a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone , interviews with the cast and crew , the original trailer , and the usual cast and crew biographies . \nthe film itself might not be the greatest , but sterling\'s effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money . \n[r] \n'",0
"b'capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be . \nmakes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence . \n "" serial killer chic "" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones . \ni\'ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . \ni wasn\'t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero . \nthankfully , that\'s not the way henry works . \nthe director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . \nit doesn\'t provide cheap-jack explanations for henry\'s behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . \nat the film\'s opening , henry\'s friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . \nin a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . \nthey are damned together from that moment on . \nhenry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . \nthe movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there\'s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . \nthe pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . \nno preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . \nin a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . \nthe movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . \nhenry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . \nmichael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . \nthe producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn\'t see release . \nthe film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . \ni\'m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of "" victim "" or "" hero "" . \nthen again , probably , so would henry . \n'",1
"b'the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length . \nif you haven\'t already figured it out , i didn\'t like this movie very much . \nthe plot was boring and contrived to the extreme . \ntarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society . \nhe is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march . \nback in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city . \n ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . ) \nanyway , tarzan\'s old jungle friend appears to him in a vision . \ntarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city . \nhe leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa . \nof course , jane is hot on her ape man\'s heals . \nthe two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys . \nsound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? \nit\'s actually an improvement over the real thing . \nthe acting is just plain awful . \ni\'m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn\'t acting . \njane march wasn\'t a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes . \ncompounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i\'ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . \nadded to the sound problems was the cinematography . \nthis film was filled with beautiful african scenery . \nbut the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me . \nquite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment . \nthen we have the special effects . \n "" special effects in a tarzan movie ?

"b""there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr . \nmagoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' . \nit may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . \nthe film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . \nloaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . \nafter escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . \nhe turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . \na country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . \nhe ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . \nnow he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . \na film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ? \nthe film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . \nit opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . \nsome of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' . \ncome on people get some new ideas already ! \nwhat's even worse is that the film has no plot at all . \nwell to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . \n'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film . \nit shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . \neven with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours . \n""",0
"b'set in the late 80\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create . \nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\'s less cryptic than ellis\' novel . \nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \nit\'s a subtle in-joke and it\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \ni\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \non a similar note , whitney houston\'s cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \napparently , houston wasn\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \ndon\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\'m still undecided . \nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\'s reality ) . \ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \nit may not change anyone\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \ni know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it . \n[r] \n'",1
"b'synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a "" phantom "" menace . \njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala\'s home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \ncan they free amidala\'s helpless planet ? \nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace\'s greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \ndirector george lucas answers , "" it\'s only a movie . "" \nto me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . \nvisually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . \nit is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . \nat least this much is clear : there\'s plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it\'s good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . \nweaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . \nat first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . \nthis dilutes the central story . \nadditionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . \nveteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . \nbetter ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . \nstrengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . \nthe film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . \nbottom line ? \nseeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . \nwe are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months . \n'",1
"b'hav plenty , as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film , is a true story . \nlife itself is a series of true stories , but most are not movie material . \nas scripted , directed , and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot , hav plenty limps along at best . \nits dialog is so stilted - "" you know what they say , \'no women ; no cry . \' "" \n- that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it . \nin the story , lee plenty ( cherot ) is a 28-year-old author and teaching assistant . \nthe movie , which happens mainly over the new year\'s holiday , consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed . \nsince he consistently refuses , caroline gooden ( tammi katherine jones ) figures that he must be gay . \neventually he and havilland "" hav "" savage ( chenoa maxwell ) get together , proving that he wasn\'t gay after all , just picky . \nsexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them , but he will not even kiss them . \nhe\'s a man who knows his mind , which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues . \nfilled with wealthy african-americans , the story is closest in tone to love jones , which was better . \nhav plenty\'s story doesn\'t go anywhere . \nat the end it subjects us to lee plenty\'s new film , which is a movie of the movie we\'ve just seen , but with even worse acting . \n "" remember folks that , as outrageous as this all seems , this is a true story . "" \nhav tells the camera , but the problem is that it\'s not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting . \nhav plenty isn\'t so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience\'s time . \nhav plenty runs 1 : 32 . \nit is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . \n'",0
"b'brian de palma\'s snake eyes stars nicolas cage\'s evil twin , who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother . \nlike a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood , cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload . \nde palma , whose last great film , the untouchables , was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic . \nin snake eyes , he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . \nonly gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . \nthe rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . \nryuichi sakamoto\'s atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . \nheavy on the long violin notes , its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . \n ( the script by de palma and lost world\'s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . \nonly the latter is achieved . ) \ncage plays rick santoro , a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money . \nthe movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held . \nwith a flashy , bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone , rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn\'t know when to shut up . \nspouting cliched and ridiculous dialog , he screams such lines as , "" i was made for the sewer , baby ! "" \nactually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole . \nsinise plays kevin dunne , a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy , who has come to watch the fight . \nbut most people in the film are not who they seem to be , and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . \nthe plot , which is told in endless flashbacks , concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen ? that adjective is , of course , redundant in hollywood thrillers . \nthe flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again , sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not . \nalthough a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence , this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . \nthe movie\'s outline has some promise , but the movie itself is leaden . \nthe film takes itself all too seriously . \nat best , it is a 1940s-style b movie . \na little humor would have helped the script some , but a complete rewrite would have been better . \nand , although i hate to say it , a different director would have been the biggest improvement . \nsnake eyes runs 1 : 39 . \nit is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers . \n'",0
"b'contact ( pg ) there\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \ncontact is clearly foster\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\'s weakest subplot ) . \njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\'s yet more wondrously pure . \nand zemeckis doesn\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\'t entertaining . \nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\'s being sold as-- "" a journey to the heart of the universe . "" \nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \n'",1
"b""this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \ngood music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . \nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . \ni don't . \n . \navoid . \n""",0
"b'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \'90s thriller . \nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\'re happening . \nthis is a very bad sign . \nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \na perfect murder isn\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \ntheir marriage isn\'t going well -- emily resents steven\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \nultimately , i\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\'re not interesting . \n ( it\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\'t . ) \nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\'s best friend . \na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \nthere aren\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \nit\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \nit\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \n'",0
